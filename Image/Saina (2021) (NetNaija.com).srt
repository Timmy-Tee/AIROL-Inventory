1
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,042
India, my country.

2
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,279
Population 1.35 billion.

3
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,917
Half of them... Female.

4
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:43,790
Ask any girl and she'll
confess the dreams she nurtures,

5
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,660
mostly remaining unfulfilled.

6
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,898
Darling son will go to college,

7
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:53,267
while daughter will
stoke the kitchen fire!

8
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:58,038
She turns 18 and she'll be married off!

9
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,641
End of story.

10
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,912
But that's not what happened to me.

11
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,648
Instead of pots & pans...

12
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:11,285
I held a sword.

13
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:19,459
I'm Saina Nehwal, daughter of India.

14
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,198
Here I stand, sword in hand,

15
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:29,903
for another test,
another battle to be won.

16
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:35,542
Who challenges me never mattered.

17
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,513
My motto, crystal clear...

18
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:44,518
Demolish the opponent.

19
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,322
Saina serving at match point.

20
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:51,658
Now for her individual
Commonwealth Games gold medal.

21
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,809
Can you guess...

22
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:16,149
the travel speed of a powerful smash
hurtling towards the opponent?

23
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:23,390
If Shoaib Akhtar's cricket
ball travels at 161 kmph,

24
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,027
Malaysia's Tan Boon Hoe's shuttle

25
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:32,933
zips at 493 kmph and
destroys the opponent.

26
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:38,939
This one of mine was 357 kmph.

27
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:41,408
And she's done it!

28
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:45,045
Saina wins the women's
singles finals here at the 2018

29
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,580
Commonwealth Games.

30
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,518
An astounding performance
from Saina Nehwal.

31
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:54,388
A very special day
for all badminton fans.

32
00:05:57,391 --> 00:06:02,162
It can be said that people
were not confident of Saina's win.

33
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,164
She really was the underdog today.

34
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:08,535
That's why this can be regarded
as a very important comeback for Saina.

35
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:13,273
And there on the court...
the Indian flag fluttering high.

36
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:18,278
Saina wins not one but two
gold medals in this tournament.

37
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:21,782
It's as if playing for her country...

38
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:25,018
lifts her game a couple
of notches to what's perfection.

39
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,688
The legend delivers yet again.

40
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:33,794
Saina Nehwal wins
2 gold medals for India.

41
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,663
Her motto is "Demolish the
opponent" and she went for the kill.

42
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,065
That's Saina Nehwal.

43
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:37,157
Saina, Saina!
Saina, Saina! Saina, Saina!

44
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:48,402
Congratulations Saina Nehwal.

45
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:49,770
Stupendous achievement.

46
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:53,807
For all of us as Indians to see
that national flag going high...

47
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:57,277
and to see that 'Jana Gana Mana'
getting sung on foreign soil.

48
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:02,182
We open the floor for Q/A now for all
of you to have an interaction with her.

49
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:16,930
Hi Saina, congratulations!

50
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:19,700
You were amazing!
What's the feeling like?

51
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:23,770
Umm...

52
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,039
How am I feeling?

53
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:28,408
Relief!

54
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:32,312
A million questions
from a thousand people.

55
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,315
How to answer?
What to answer?

56
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,785
Ya, I'm feeling very happy.

57
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:43,790
She gave me a tough fight
and it's a proud moment for India.

58
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:47,461
Hello Saina, after your success...

59
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,429
What was the turning point for you?

60
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:53,166
How do you manage to keep
your adrenaline rush in check?

61
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,035
Some of us were with you in Rio...

62
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:57,538
What do you prefer?
Win or Loss?

63
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:03,544
Of course, a win! Who wouldn't?

64
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:08,682
If I'd lost today, the verdict would be...

65
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:11,518
...the sun has set.

66
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,387
It's over for Saina.

67
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,290
Losses and wins keep happening.

68
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,825
Today she lost.

69
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,328
It's all part of the game.

70
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:24,331
We don't see this spirit in everyone.

71
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:27,267
From where do you muster this
courage, this strength?

72
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:30,204
My mother.

73
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:31,538
She's bullheaded...

74
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:37,444
...and I'm her child...

75
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:40,914
It's the DNA...What can I do?

76
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,022
Do you understand 'womb'?

77
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:55,662
Mother's womb.

78
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:01,835
The earliest lessons began from there.

79
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:16,683
Felt like I was being
tossed around in stormy waters.

80
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:22,890
What are you up to?

81
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,192
Stop being so stubborn.
Is it important to win?

82
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,061
Of course! I'm a Jat woman.

83
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:31,765
Won't quit until I win!

84
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:52,286
Somehow this ship
managed to find harbour.

85
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,660
Congratulations, it's a baby girl!

86
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:02,429
And from her full-throated wails,

87
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,932
seems very powerful.

88
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:23,817
Saina!

89
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:28,789
Ma! Ma,
look Saina is irritating me.

90
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:30,290
Statue! Statue!

91
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,293
Enough of this!

92
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,664
Doctor Saab,
why are you frozen like a statue?

93
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,333
You continue unpacking.

94
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,568
Statue's for the kids.

95
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:43,437
They're getting on my nerves!

96
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:49,409
Did you get details about
the badminton academy like I'd asked you to?

97
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:55,282
Oh god! Okay, okay.
Statue's off for you.

98
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,783
But not for you girls! Stay frozen.

99
00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:59,319
Tell me!

100
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:05,025
What's with this stretching?
Tell me quickly.

101
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:08,295
It's 25 kms away.

102
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,198
Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium.

103
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,033
They all teach there.

104
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:17,137
Nani Sir, Meru Sir, Aarif Sir.

105
00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:18,205
So...

106
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,909
should I pickle this information?

107
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,545
The point is when are you
going to take this little one there?

108
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:27,014
Can't you see, she's turning
the whole house on its head?

109
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,284
...Have a backache.

110
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:33,887
Doctor Saab, you let it be.

111
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:36,890
You get ready, I'll take you there.

112
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:38,959
You just give me the bus fare.

113
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:41,662
C'mon get going, hurry up.

114
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:03,784
An hour already of this Hyderabad tour!

115
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,888
When will we reach Lal
Bahadur Shastri Stadium?

116
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:29,643
The holy pilgrimage of badminton.

117
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,813
Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium.

118
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,148
LBS.

119
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,452
Big coaches!

120
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:39,920
Champion players!

121
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:45,292
An opportunity waiting to be grabbed!

122
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:47,828
Had to make a mark!

123
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,764
-What is your name?
-Anshika.

124
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:53,166
-Anshika. Yours?
-Tanishka.

125
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,035
-Sir...
-Joining date?

126
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,403
16th April.

127
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,071
Ma'am please don't disturb.

128
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,908
-Sorry sir. Please continue.
-Father's name?

129
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:02,309
Mohit.

130
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:05,279
Yes, please speak.

131
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:10,150
Sir, I want to enroll my daughter.

132
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,286
Admissions are full, madam!

133
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:16,657
Tanshika, Anshika, go to court 1.

134
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,793
Sir, please give her a chance...

135
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:36,443
Saina look!

136
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:39,513
Pick up the racket!

137
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:44,284
Show them your game.
Only then will they take notice of you.

138
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,324
Best of luck and play full power!

139
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:56,396
Out! Player change.

140
00:14:57,531 --> 00:14:58,265
Serve.

141
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:01,568
Hit it! Hit it!

142
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,437
Yes, smashing!

143
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,806
Wonderful. Very nice!

144
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:13,514
Stop!

145
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,149
Whose racket is this?
Where are your badminton shoes?

146
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:16,783
Out!

147
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,418
Hey, stop.

148
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,520
Stop it.

149
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:30,898
Sir,...

150
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,568
she can't follow your language.
We're from Haryana.

151
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:37,571
-Are you her mother?
-Yes!

152
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,707
Mrs. Usha Rani Harvir Singhji Nehwal

153
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:43,277
and she's my younger one - Saina.

154
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,545
Saina.

155
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:46,580
Show me your grip.

156
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:48,649
Hey!

157
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,317
You're holding a racket or a sword?

158
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,419
Who's taught you this?

159
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,655
Sir, it's... it's me.

160
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:55,822
So do you also play?

161
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,892
Oh yes! I used to play
district level in Haryana.

162
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:06,200
We're from Hisar, not Panipat.

163
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:08,435
We just shifted to
Rajendra Nagar last week.

164
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:10,404
My husband is a PhD.

165
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:14,641
You bring her from tomorrow
for regular coaching.

166
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:16,543
For sword fighting!

167
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,414
Okay child, go and play now.

168
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,515
Kashyap!

169
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:24,918
Play with our warrior princess-
Rani Rudrama Devi.

170
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,660
She's selected!

171
00:16:33,794 --> 00:16:35,762
-She's selected!
-What?

172
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:37,564
She's selected!

173
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:41,768
She demolished everybody!

174
00:16:41,902 --> 00:16:45,639
No proper shoes,
just picked a racket and pushed her in.

175
00:16:49,643 --> 00:16:54,014
She shocked girls head-taller than her.

176
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:56,950
The coach came to you after that...

177
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:59,820
and he said something
you didn't understand...

178
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:04,525
I told him that we aren't from here.
We are from Haryana.

179
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:08,662
And then we cracked it!

180
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:17,137
From tomorrow it's
regular coaching for her.

181
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:19,406
You mean tomorrow?

182
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,910
Yes Sir! Every morning
she has to reach at 5.

183
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:26,914
Fill up the scooter.
You'd said it's 25 kms away.

184
00:17:29,283 --> 00:17:31,185
She's a champion.

185
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:34,188
You'll be World No. 1.

186
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:37,791
If not, you'll make her one.
Right Usha Rani?

187
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,397
I've peeled potatoes.

188
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:44,565
Should I toss them?

189
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:49,703
No! Today we'll have
parathas with white butter.

190
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:10,557
A place where breath doesn't race

191
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:17,898
Sleeping in even pace

192
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:25,038
where trees cast long
shadows that reach river banks

193
00:18:25,906 --> 00:18:32,179
where the moon still
shines in still lakes

194
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:39,019
No conditions set on mirth

195
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:46,059
No fear of living on earth

196
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:53,166
Let me take you there,
Let me take you there

197
00:18:53,700 --> 00:19:00,440
...To beat a new path

198
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:23,063
That first day of
coaching at LBS Academy...

199
00:19:23,764 --> 00:19:25,165
Magical environment...

200
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:27,067
and Meru sir...

201
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:29,436
Buddy...

202
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:32,139
Blunt but with a heart of gold.

203
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,309
Why would anyone want
to do anything else!

204
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:40,514
Children, come, come.

205
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:44,918
Settle down.

206
00:19:46,954 --> 00:19:48,021
Settle down.

207
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:49,289
Quick, quick.

208
00:19:50,891 --> 00:19:51,892
Shhhh...

209
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,330
In India, people

210
00:19:56,663 --> 00:20:00,200
play in their backyards

211
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:04,638
singing retro songs and call it
playing badminton.

212
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:07,641
Well that's not badminton.

213
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:09,943
Badminton is an indoor game.

214
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,578
An expensive game.

215
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:14,648
A shuttle drum costs 3000 bucks!

216
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:18,418
And to give wind to
this shuttle you need 5 S's...

217
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,954
Stamina.

218
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:22,523
Speed.

219
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,291
Strength.

220
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:26,693
Skill and...

221
00:20:27,928 --> 00:20:30,664
Spirit!

222
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:32,900
Hold on to them.

223
00:20:33,534 --> 00:20:34,401
Understood?

224
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,537
-Yes!
-Good.

225
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,272
Come on, get back to your courts.

226
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,907
Quick, quick.

227
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,644
Stamina lies in your roots.

228
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:47,281
And speed is in your DNA.

229
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:49,950
For strength....

230
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:55,889
I'll feed you parathas
with white butter,

231
00:20:56,557 --> 00:20:59,826
almonds and fruit juice.

232
00:21:00,294 --> 00:21:04,264
Skills, your sir will impart.

233
00:21:04,398 --> 00:21:07,401
And spirit... I'll blow that into you!

234
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:11,572
Get ready, quick!

235
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:28,288
Come on, good going.
Keep it fast!

236
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:30,390
Training was in full force.

237
00:21:31,325 --> 00:21:32,459
Wrist movement.

238
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:33,794
Shadows.

239
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:35,429
Reflexes.

240
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:36,930
And speed.

241
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,667
Lift!

242
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:42,703
Toss!

243
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:44,638
Keep!

244
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:46,773
Tap!

245
00:21:47,908 --> 00:21:48,408
Smash!

246
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:49,443
Three!

247
00:21:51,078 --> 00:21:53,514
No excuses! Drink it up!

248
00:22:00,954 --> 00:22:03,524
My badminton foundation
was laid at LBS.

249
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:07,528
Also, I found my band-of-boys...

250
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:11,532
Nutty Damodar, endearing Rohan...

251
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:13,901
and most special...

252
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:15,669
Kashyap.

253
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:29,316
Sir, enter Saina for
the district competition.

254
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:31,151
What're you saying Mrs. Nehwal!

255
00:22:31,652 --> 00:22:32,452
She's just...

256
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:35,656
Sir, competition is a great teacher.

257
00:22:35,889 --> 00:22:38,559
But Mrs. Nehwal,
she's just learnt to hold a racket!

258
00:22:39,326 --> 00:22:43,764
Sir, you give the bird the
sky and it'll surely take flight.

259
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:59,012
First game won by Saina Nehwal.

260
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:02,816
Second game.

261
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,951
Love all.

262
00:23:04,284 --> 00:23:05,018
Play.

263
00:23:12,793 --> 00:23:14,828
Point goes to Saina Nehwal.

264
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:18,432
Out!

265
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:25,439
Under-10 singles,
won by Saina Nehwal.

266
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:31,044
Very good.
Sit, sit.

267
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:32,646
I'll get milk for you.

268
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:37,084
Make sure all the children get milk!

269
00:23:37,518 --> 00:23:40,287
Quick! Quick!

270
00:23:41,054 --> 00:23:43,957
Match point for Saina
Nehwal & Riya Singh.

271
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:54,768
Under-10 doubles won
by Saina Nehwal & Riya Singh.

272
00:23:57,704 --> 00:24:01,408
Under-13 singles won by Saina Nehwal.

273
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:04,678
This is the magic of milk.

274
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:12,920
Under-13 doubles won by
Saina Nehwal and Mithila Shah.

275
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:15,789
Hey, Meru.

276
00:24:16,023 --> 00:24:17,157
Where did you find her?

277
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:19,893
I've been observing her since morning.

278
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:21,528
She sits stoic.

279
00:24:21,895 --> 00:24:23,263
Mother brings her two glasses of milk.

280
00:24:23,397 --> 00:24:24,398
She gulps them down.

281
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:26,900
Gets up, plays and wins!
Back again, sits,...

282
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:29,670
...gulps, up, plays and wins.

283
00:24:30,204 --> 00:24:33,040
In 4 hours she's won 4 state titles!

284
00:24:34,408 --> 00:24:35,409
Who is she?

285
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:36,577
Rana Sir.

286
00:24:37,077 --> 00:24:37,911
Saina Nehwal.

287
00:24:38,512 --> 00:24:44,151
An 8-year old child from Hisar rewrites
history in Vishakapatnam's State tournament.

288
00:24:44,418 --> 00:24:51,158
She has earned a state record by
winning 4 state titles in a single day.

289
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:56,530
To dream of becoming No.1
is not without hazards.

290
00:25:07,908 --> 00:25:09,643
Match won by Aditi Mutatkar.

291
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:11,445
11-7, 11-9.

292
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:14,448
Because if I deliver No. 2 instead of 1...

293
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:15,516
Mummy.

294
00:25:18,151 --> 00:25:21,522
I had stood 2nd in the
National ranking tournament...

295
00:25:22,322 --> 00:25:24,024
and this was the reward I got.

296
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:30,030
Repeatedly I've warned
her but she doesn't listen!

297
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,565
Gets dumbfounded.

298
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:35,402
Gave away 3 precious
points just like that.

299
00:25:35,836 --> 00:25:37,938
Couldn't you see the shuttle
was headed out of line?

300
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,044
And what's that overhead
smash instead of a backhand shot?

301
00:25:45,646 --> 00:25:46,914
Let her be.

302
00:25:47,281 --> 00:25:49,149
Winning and losing are part of sports.

303
00:25:49,783 --> 00:25:51,785
Someone has to lose.

304
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,687
Today it's you,
tomorrow it's me.

305
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,556
Don't butt in!

306
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:58,825
No need to fill her head up with ideas.

307
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:02,930
Lend her a shoulder and
you'll cripple her for life.

308
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:06,934
Don't glare at me!

309
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:08,669
Go to your room.

310
00:26:09,036 --> 00:26:10,771
Sit with your books and study.

311
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:16,310
Didn't hear what I said?

312
00:26:19,012 --> 00:26:20,447
And no dinner for you today!

313
00:26:24,818 --> 00:26:27,321
Let it sink in first...

314
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:29,957
Take this.

315
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:32,526
Toss it.

316
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:58,352
Winning is prime for your mother.

317
00:27:01,388 --> 00:27:02,723
Let me tell you an incident.

318
00:27:03,357 --> 00:27:04,391
Back in Hisar,

319
00:27:04,725 --> 00:27:08,028
I used to play mixed-doubles
with your mother as partner.

320
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:12,599
Then she lost the finals...

321
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:14,034
because of me.

322
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:15,769
Guess what she did?

323
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:18,639
She changed partners.

324
00:27:19,106 --> 00:27:20,474
She dumped me!

325
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:26,413
Partnered with a
Mr. Ramesh Chand in order to win.

326
00:27:28,015 --> 00:27:29,249
Frankly I feared...

327
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:32,786
she might run away
with Mr. Ramesh Chand!

328
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:38,625
Did Ma win?

329
00:27:40,627 --> 00:27:41,361
Yes.

330
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,100
Now eat.

331
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:52,906
Tasty vegetable...

332
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:56,376
and roti.

333
00:27:57,978 --> 00:27:59,646
Papa is very, very special.

334
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:01,481
Very good, my tigress!

335
00:28:01,615 --> 00:28:04,484
Like Balraj Sahni of Do Bigha Zamin...

336
00:28:04,985 --> 00:28:06,253
standing behind, stoic.

337
00:28:08,488 --> 00:28:10,991
Earlier I used to imagine
Ma to be everything.

338
00:28:12,492 --> 00:28:15,495
The tough, spirited, decision maker!

339
00:28:20,234 --> 00:28:23,003
Learnt about Papa's quiet
contribution much later.

340
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:30,544
Papa shuttle!

341
00:28:30,744 --> 00:28:31,478
Yes.

342
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:33,847
Here it is.

343
00:28:49,863 --> 00:28:50,864
Excuse me.

344
00:28:51,265 --> 00:28:52,733
Can you please lend me 2 shuttles?

345
00:28:52,866 --> 00:28:54,034
I'll return them tomorrow.

346
00:28:54,101 --> 00:28:55,669
I don't have, sorry.

347
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,238
Can I borrow 2 shuttles?

348
00:28:58,372 --> 00:29:01,375
I'll give them back tomorrow,
definitely.

349
00:29:01,475 --> 00:29:02,109
Sorry...

350
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:07,614
A drum of 10 shuttles costs 3000 Rupees.

351
00:29:08,115 --> 00:29:10,784
How long will you keep
begging for them 2 at a time?

352
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:13,387
Forget badminton.

353
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,022
Not for everyone.

354
00:29:15,522 --> 00:29:17,858
Give her education.
Make her able.

355
00:29:19,026 --> 00:29:19,793
Got it?

356
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:33,974
Come in!

357
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:36,476
Sir!

358
00:29:36,743 --> 00:29:37,878
What happened Doc?

359
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:39,112
Why are you panting?

360
00:29:39,346 --> 00:29:41,515
Sir, I wanted a PF Loan, urgently.

361
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:42,983
Why?

362
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,518
Sir, I wanted a shuttle...

363
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:47,287
I mean, made a
lunge to grab the shuttle...

364
00:29:47,387 --> 00:29:53,994
slipped and fractured the small toe...
also a ligament tear.

365
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:55,596
Whose?

366
00:29:55,996 --> 00:29:58,732
My dau...
I mean, my wife.

367
00:29:59,032 --> 00:30:00,234
Oh, I see.

368
00:30:00,501 --> 00:30:02,870
Must do it urgently. Hand it to me.

369
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,137
Please sir.

370
00:30:09,409 --> 00:30:11,144
Take the day off.

371
00:30:14,348 --> 00:30:16,984
Thank you sir.
I'll take care of my wife, sir.

372
00:30:18,252 --> 00:30:18,986
Thank you sir.

373
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,101
Papa shuttle.

374
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:39,640
Papa kept handing me
shuttles and I kept smashing.

375
00:30:40,107 --> 00:30:41,909
I made it to the papers.

376
00:30:44,044 --> 00:30:48,282
Papa made minuscule
reports look like headlines.

377
00:30:49,616 --> 00:30:51,518
Saina Nehwal bags
a triple in the state.

378
00:30:51,652 --> 00:30:54,988
Under-10 singles,
Under-13 singles & doubles.

379
00:30:56,857 --> 00:31:01,128
Saina Nehwal from Andhra Pradesh emerges
victorious at the Sub-Junior Nationals.

380
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:06,233
She has left her mark
with her exceptional talents.

381
00:31:09,102 --> 00:31:13,373
Each tournament,
each win, each medal, each award...

382
00:31:14,474 --> 00:31:17,644
a result of mother's glowing spirit!

383
00:31:18,846 --> 00:31:23,617
Ma & Papa...
like fire & water.

384
00:31:24,985 --> 00:31:30,123
This harmonious balance brought a
little baby girl from Haryana

385
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:34,027
into the arena of the
National Singles Finals.

386
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:39,499
And another one for Saina Nehwal as
she storms into the National Finals.

387
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:45,539
Today we are at Chennai's Chidambaram Gardens
for the Junior National Championship.

388
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:49,977
Saina Nehwal, the emerging player
from Andhra Pradesh will face the...

389
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:54,248
3-time National Champion
Shehnaz Rizvi from Uttar Pradesh.

390
00:31:55,148 --> 00:31:58,418
And Saina makes sure Shehnaz
fails to score any point.

391
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:03,490
Saina is just one point
away from winning this game.

392
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:12,165
11-love.
Game won by Saina Nehwal.

393
00:32:15,002 --> 00:32:17,971
Wonderful performance!

394
00:32:20,474 --> 00:32:22,109
They call her the wrestler from Haryana.

395
00:32:22,242 --> 00:32:23,377
She showed them.

396
00:32:25,646 --> 00:32:26,513
11-love.

397
00:32:26,747 --> 00:32:29,116
Do you realize?
It's the National finals!

398
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:30,851
Not at all.

399
00:32:30,984 --> 00:32:33,120
Looks like Shehnaz's been called
for Saina's practice.

400
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,021
Change sides.

401
00:32:36,223 --> 00:32:37,991
Not so soon buddy!
Second game still remains.

402
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:39,526
She could lose.

403
00:32:40,027 --> 00:32:42,996
Always negative.
Buzz off!

404
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,098
Wait and watch.

405
00:32:59,112 --> 00:33:00,781
Out! Service change.

406
00:33:01,782 --> 00:33:02,983
Love-all.

407
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,887
No problem.
She is still leading.

408
00:33:15,362 --> 00:33:16,230
C'mon!

409
00:33:17,598 --> 00:33:18,532
1-love.

410
00:33:24,605 --> 00:33:25,772
2-love.

411
00:33:30,744 --> 00:33:32,012
3-love.

412
00:33:41,355 --> 00:33:42,623
4-love.

413
00:33:42,723 --> 00:33:44,892
Look, she is going to lose.

414
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:45,993
Shut up!

415
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:57,404
In the spirit of winning,
no room for failure

416
00:33:58,605 --> 00:34:01,241
C'mon Saina!

417
00:34:04,111 --> 00:34:10,250
One life is all there is,
no second thought

418
00:34:16,623 --> 00:34:18,158
Great one!

419
00:34:18,992 --> 00:34:19,893
Service change.

420
00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:21,228
Love-4.

421
00:34:21,595 --> 00:34:22,596
Just focus.

422
00:34:25,365 --> 00:34:28,669
-Why be a bird,
-1-4.

423
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:31,471
-When the sky is what I want to be
-She did a cross drop!

424
00:34:31,605 --> 00:34:34,741
Why remain a mere page,

425
00:34:34,975 --> 00:34:37,611
-When an epic is what I want to be
-That's it!

426
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:40,280
-3-4.
-Why be a bird,

427
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,416
-When the sky is what I want to be
-4 All

428
00:34:42,516 --> 00:34:44,151
-5-4.
-Come on Shehnaz!

429
00:34:44,284 --> 00:34:46,987
Why remain a mere page,

430
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,123
When an epic is what I want to be

431
00:34:50,157 --> 00:34:51,525
8-4.

432
00:34:57,364 --> 00:35:01,235
She won! She won the Nationals!

433
00:35:04,538 --> 00:35:07,374
Game and match point
won by Saina Nehwal.

434
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:08,976
11-love.
11-4.

435
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:10,377
Go Saina!

436
00:35:17,351 --> 00:35:24,124
Saina, Saina! Saina, Saina!

437
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:27,127
Haryana's buffalo, fatso...

438
00:35:27,227 --> 00:35:29,496
can't recall what
all they used to call me.

439
00:35:29,863 --> 00:35:32,099
But thanks to the
spirit which Ma fueled,

440
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,602
I shined at the Nationals.

441
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,228
Hold on! Hold on!

442
00:36:02,262 --> 00:36:03,730
You're back!

443
00:36:03,897 --> 00:36:07,100
Look, what's come today.

444
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:10,637
Finally, it's arrived!

445
00:36:12,406 --> 00:36:14,741
You're going to play for India!

446
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:17,611
You're going to play for India!

447
00:36:18,145 --> 00:36:19,980
You're going to play for India!

448
00:36:21,982 --> 00:36:23,784
I knew it for over a week.

449
00:36:25,118 --> 00:36:26,486
You hid this from me?

450
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:31,124
Your mother?
Gotten wiser, haven't you?

451
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:33,026
Let me hold it.

452
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:35,095
Hmm...

453
00:36:36,597 --> 00:36:37,397
Nice, isn't it?

454
00:36:39,233 --> 00:36:40,367
How does it look?

455
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:41,902
Suits you.

456
00:36:44,104 --> 00:36:45,739
Make sure you win.

457
00:36:50,744 --> 00:36:53,113
You've fulfilled my dream.

458
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:16,236
She's a champion.

459
00:37:18,372 --> 00:37:20,140
"And if she doesn't,
you'll make her one"

460
00:37:21,475 --> 00:37:23,377
Isn't that what you'd said?

461
00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:28,482
Finally my champion
is heading overseas...

462
00:37:30,851 --> 00:37:34,354
to play the Czech Open in Prague.

463
00:37:37,491 --> 00:37:39,359
She'll represent India!

464
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,666
My daughter will play for India.

465
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:04,418
I should go and get your things.

466
00:38:04,751 --> 00:38:05,986
We're leaving in 2 days.

467
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,221
What kind of things?

468
00:38:07,654 --> 00:38:08,856
Don't increase the baggage weight, Ma.

469
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:12,392
Cashews, almonds, pistachios...
you don't worry about the weight.

470
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:16,730
Together we're allowed 46 kgs.

471
00:38:16,997 --> 00:38:19,099
I've nothing to carry.
So it'll be fine.

472
00:38:21,001 --> 00:38:22,035
Should I come with you?

473
00:38:22,102 --> 00:38:24,371
No, you recover.

474
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:28,609
You've an evening session at 6.
I'll be back by then.

475
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:32,346
Should I get you a film DVD?

476
00:38:33,113 --> 00:38:33,981
Yes.

477
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:35,849
Any Shahrukh Khan film will do.

478
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:57,604
-Saina!
-Yes?

479
00:38:57,905 --> 00:39:00,874
Somebody fetch water.

480
00:39:00,974 --> 00:39:03,110
Mummy! Mummy!!
One minute.

481
00:39:03,243 --> 00:39:04,111
Mummy!

482
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:05,245
Mummy!

483
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:10,284
No, Papa is not at home.
He's not here.

484
00:39:10,484 --> 00:39:11,351
Mummy!

485
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:12,986
Mummy!

486
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:15,989
Mummy!

487
00:39:17,224 --> 00:39:18,225
Mummy!

488
00:39:19,726 --> 00:39:22,362
-Where has the ambulance reached?
-On its way.

489
00:39:22,496 --> 00:39:23,997
She's bleeding profusely!

490
00:39:28,735 --> 00:39:29,503
Mummy!

491
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:31,104
Mummy!

492
00:39:34,474 --> 00:39:35,609
Patient status?

493
00:39:35,976 --> 00:39:39,146
Going into tachycardia doctor.
High chance of internal bleeding.

494
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:40,781
Oxygen level?

495
00:39:40,914 --> 00:39:42,482
Dropping to 90%.

496
00:39:43,116 --> 00:39:44,985
2 litres of oxygen on flow.

497
00:39:47,988 --> 00:39:50,224
Six and a half hours in surgery...

498
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:53,493
and yet no idea...

499
00:39:54,494 --> 00:39:56,396
if she'll survive or not.

500
00:39:57,898 --> 00:40:01,768
Snatching back a hundred times
more than what you've given us...

501
00:40:02,536 --> 00:40:05,606
... what is to happen Ma?

502
00:41:04,998 --> 00:41:05,999
What happened?

503
00:41:08,101 --> 00:41:09,269
Where are you going?

504
00:41:11,605 --> 00:41:12,973
I'm heading for practice.

505
00:41:13,907 --> 00:41:14,741
Pract...

506
00:41:15,876 --> 00:41:17,778
but these are moments for prayer.

507
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:23,750
That's what I am heading to do.

508
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:53,413
A place where breath doesn't race

509
00:41:54,515 --> 00:42:00,153
Sleeping in even pace

510
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:07,361
where trees cast long
shadows that reach river banks

511
00:42:08,228 --> 00:42:14,034
-where the moon still shines in still lakes
-Serve!

512
00:42:15,102 --> 00:42:21,108
No conditions set on mirth

513
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:27,614
No fear of living on earth

514
00:42:28,282 --> 00:42:34,488
Let me take you there,
Let me take you there

515
00:42:35,122 --> 00:42:40,727
...To beat a new path

516
00:42:40,861 --> 00:42:46,400
Today, I would've smashed even
a solid cricket ball at 440 kmph!!!

517
00:42:46,867 --> 00:42:50,771
Each smash, a plea.
Like clanging huge temple bells...

518
00:42:52,272 --> 00:42:56,777
calling out to the
Almighty to save Ma's life.

519
00:42:57,744 --> 00:42:59,646
But no answer.

520
00:43:17,231 --> 00:43:23,237
Fearlessly step out of home,

521
00:43:24,104 --> 00:43:30,244
Your heart shall lead you there...

522
00:43:31,044 --> 00:43:34,615
It's the finals of the Junior Women
Singles here at Prague. The Czech Open.

523
00:43:34,748 --> 00:43:36,750
And making her way at courtside,

524
00:43:36,917 --> 00:43:41,221
Saina Nehwal of India facing
Yana Vorotnykova of Ukraine.

525
00:43:44,157 --> 00:43:50,264
Where eyes have never known tears,

526
00:43:50,998 --> 00:43:57,037
Finding a hundred excuses to smile...

527
00:43:57,404 --> 00:43:59,373
Let me take you there,

528
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:02,476
They both have been in tremendous
form all along in this tournament.

529
00:44:04,378 --> 00:44:10,284
-Yana getting us underway.

530
00:44:11,351 --> 00:44:14,488
A brilliant smash.
Saina under pressure now.

531
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:20,627
- Yet again she catches
Saina wrong footed.

532
00:44:20,727 --> 00:44:23,897
Reeling off winner after
winner from her racket.

533
00:44:24,765 --> 00:44:27,868
And Saina making a comeback.
Brilliant play at the net.

534
00:44:28,235 --> 00:44:31,405
Superb placement.
And now for a change of pace,

535
00:44:31,605 --> 00:44:33,473
a lovely smash.

536
00:44:33,607 --> 00:44:35,542
And brilliant placing again!

537
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:39,146
Down the line smash and she's won it!

538
00:44:39,279 --> 00:44:41,281
Saina Nehwal from India.

539
00:44:41,415 --> 00:44:45,485
The winner of the final
here in Prague at the Czech Open.

540
00:44:45,752 --> 00:44:48,222
Playing on a big stage
for the first time.

541
00:44:48,355 --> 00:44:51,491
This young girl hasn't
let her country down.

542
00:44:51,792 --> 00:44:54,127
She has caused a major upset here.

543
00:44:56,096 --> 00:45:00,000
The entire nation must be
celebrating this extraordinary win.

544
00:45:07,975 --> 00:45:08,876
Yes?

545
00:45:43,277 --> 00:45:45,412
Hey champion!

546
00:45:47,281 --> 00:45:50,484
Be careful! She might get hurt.

547
00:45:53,987 --> 00:45:57,024
Mummy, you had me scared!

548
00:45:57,491 --> 00:46:01,395
Show me...

549
00:46:01,528 --> 00:46:02,863
Just see!

550
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:13,740
The rightful owner of this medal...

551
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:20,480
Usha Rani Harvir Singh Nehwal aka Mummy!

552
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:33,493
What?

553
00:46:35,162 --> 00:46:37,030
Yes, it's for you.

554
00:46:38,098 --> 00:46:39,099
Hand it over.

555
00:46:45,105 --> 00:46:47,474
Kashyap's face was a sight.

556
00:46:48,275 --> 00:46:50,611
Mummy snatched the entire bouquet.

557
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:55,115
He somehow
managed to save one for me.

558
00:46:58,018 --> 00:46:59,353
What's wrong with you today?

559
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,488
She took...

560
00:47:11,899 --> 00:47:12,866
He is special.

561
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:19,973
Like badminton,
in life, timing is very important.

562
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:23,110
You miss the bus, you lost your chance.

563
00:47:27,281 --> 00:47:30,117
Rajan is opening an academy in this city

564
00:47:31,151 --> 00:47:34,621
so that talented players
get a chance to prove themselves.

565
00:47:36,156 --> 00:47:40,160
The middle class in their struggle
for security burn out.

566
00:47:40,894 --> 00:47:43,497
Dreams & passions remain unfulfilled.

567
00:47:45,999 --> 00:47:50,137
I've seen how tired soles wear out
hustling for a single shuttle.

568
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:53,140
He'll teach... for free.

569
00:47:54,274 --> 00:47:57,778
No money but he'll
demand herculean effort.

570
00:47:58,745 --> 00:47:59,847
Not easy.

571
00:48:00,614 --> 00:48:04,117
Powered like a tiger and
disciplined like an Army General.

572
00:48:05,352 --> 00:48:08,021
If you can withstand that,
you get to play.

573
00:48:09,356 --> 00:48:11,525
He's called us at 5, today.

574
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:16,230
I've brought you up to here
but if you want to be world champs,

575
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:20,000
I strongly recommend you
guys joining Rajan Academy.

576
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:44,391
LBS Stadium...

577
00:48:45,492 --> 00:48:47,127
Like mother's home...

578
00:48:49,229 --> 00:48:51,098
Not easy to leave...

579
00:48:56,003 --> 00:49:01,875
The home that absorbed
all my idiosyncrasies...

580
00:49:03,043 --> 00:49:07,614
I was stepping out of it's
threshold for the first time,

581
00:49:08,515 --> 00:49:11,018
to count mother's dreams.

582
00:49:24,231 --> 00:49:25,365
Rajan Sir!

583
00:49:50,657 --> 00:49:51,725
Good morning champions!

584
00:49:51,859 --> 00:49:52,860
Good morning sir!

585
00:49:53,627 --> 00:49:54,862
I'm Rajan.

586
00:49:55,996 --> 00:49:57,164
Welcome to my Academy.

587
00:49:58,398 --> 00:50:00,000
Why've you guys come to me?

588
00:50:01,268 --> 00:50:02,236
Anyone?

589
00:50:06,607 --> 00:50:09,476
Actually I don't really know why.

590
00:50:12,613 --> 00:50:17,150
But I clearly know why
I've built this academy.

591
00:50:17,985 --> 00:50:21,021
If you want an admission
in college through the sports quota,

592
00:50:21,622 --> 00:50:23,490
I have no place for you.

593
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:26,894
You want to show off
your medals and get a job,

594
00:50:27,294 --> 00:50:29,096
I have no place for you.

595
00:50:29,396 --> 00:50:31,498
You want to use it as
a passport to travel the world...

596
00:50:31,865 --> 00:50:32,900
Get Out!

597
00:50:34,535 --> 00:50:35,602
Right now!

598
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:37,604
Don't waste my time.

599
00:50:40,741 --> 00:50:43,410
I haven't built this
academy to mint money.

600
00:50:45,345 --> 00:50:48,148
I have built this academy
to create champions.

601
00:50:49,116 --> 00:50:50,784
When I was on a winning spree,

602
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:53,620
I could've easily...

603
00:50:54,788 --> 00:50:58,992
modelled for soft drinks, the ads
hanging from corner stores.

604
00:50:59,226 --> 00:51:00,627
Comfortable life.

605
00:51:00,994 --> 00:51:02,162
Pots of money.

606
00:51:03,864 --> 00:51:07,000
But that would make me a
model and not a champion.

607
00:51:10,871 --> 00:51:11,471
No!

608
00:51:13,273 --> 00:51:14,641
Didn't want that.

609
00:51:16,109 --> 00:51:17,244
As for you,...

610
00:51:18,045 --> 00:51:19,746
I don't want a champion...

611
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:22,482
who thinks of winning.

612
00:51:23,116 --> 00:51:24,518
I want a champion who...

613
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:28,121
thinks of winning...
and... nothing... else!

614
00:51:28,989 --> 00:51:31,558
So tell me...

615
00:51:32,226 --> 00:51:36,496
who thinks he'll become World No.1
badminton player?

616
00:51:41,001 --> 00:51:41,869
Very good.

617
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:44,905
At least you think that way.

618
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,141
This hunger is necessary.

619
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:54,281
But as you know,
the Taj Mahal was not built in a day.

620
00:51:55,782 --> 00:51:57,651
It requires a system.

621
00:51:58,752 --> 00:52:00,354
And I have that system.

622
00:52:01,221 --> 00:52:03,624
If you follow that system,
you'll win all the matches.

623
00:52:03,724 --> 00:52:04,892
That's my promise.

624
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,030
But if you break any
rule of the academy...

625
00:52:11,231 --> 00:52:12,266
then you're out!

626
00:52:13,734 --> 00:52:15,502
One mistake and you are out!

627
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:17,271
Got that?

628
00:52:17,404 --> 00:52:18,238
Yes sir.

629
00:52:18,372 --> 00:52:19,873
-Got that?
-Yes Sir!

630
00:52:22,609 --> 00:52:23,977
So you're waiting for coffee?

631
00:52:24,244 --> 00:52:25,145
Let's start!

632
00:52:52,105 --> 00:52:52,873
Okay start!

633
00:53:10,123 --> 00:53:11,024
Stop it!

634
00:53:12,993 --> 00:53:13,861
Saina!

635
00:53:14,895 --> 00:53:15,729
Follow me.

636
00:53:38,919 --> 00:53:41,622
Saina, what's your diet regime?

637
00:53:43,991 --> 00:53:47,394
Sir? There's nothing like a diet regime.

638
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:50,864
What do you eat?

639
00:53:51,865 --> 00:53:53,100
Let's start with breakfast.

640
00:53:56,003 --> 00:53:57,871
Sir, for breakfast...

641
00:53:58,105 --> 00:53:59,873
aloo parathas and a glass of milk.

642
00:54:00,374 --> 00:54:01,275
How many?

643
00:54:02,876 --> 00:54:06,613
4-5 parathas and Ma's instructions...
1.25 liters of milk daily.

644
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,748
Lunch?

645
00:54:08,615 --> 00:54:12,486
Lunch... dal with rice, rotis and curd...

646
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:13,620
Got it, got it.

647
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:17,391
Saina...

648
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,995
your diet and your game...

649
00:54:22,863 --> 00:54:23,997
are interlinked.

650
00:54:24,665 --> 00:54:27,234
Badminton doesn't mean only power.

651
00:54:28,001 --> 00:54:30,237
It's not wrestling!

652
00:54:31,104 --> 00:54:32,105
It's very...

653
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,741
...delicate.

654
00:54:35,042 --> 00:54:36,410
How to put it...

655
00:54:39,246 --> 00:54:42,482
delicate (in Urdu).

656
00:54:44,518 --> 00:54:46,787
Your smashes are good but...

657
00:54:47,487 --> 00:54:49,289
smashes is not the game.

658
00:54:50,123 --> 00:54:53,227
With strength,
you need to be agile... like a cat.

659
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,729
You know.
You've to be light on your feet.

660
00:54:56,096 --> 00:54:58,232
Right now you're landing very heavy.

661
00:54:59,666 --> 00:55:01,034
Reduce 10 kgs.

662
00:55:01,368 --> 00:55:02,503
That too quickly.

663
00:55:02,603 --> 00:55:07,107
So basically no parathas,
no milk, no curd, no ice cream.

664
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:08,876
I want results...

665
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:10,744
fast!

666
00:55:11,612 --> 00:55:12,346
Got it?

667
00:55:13,914 --> 00:55:15,516
This is your diet chart.

668
00:55:16,116 --> 00:55:17,751
Follow it like the bible.

669
00:55:18,986 --> 00:55:23,357
Sir, what do you mean by no milk?
I have to drink milk.

670
00:55:27,127 --> 00:55:28,028
Go!

671
00:55:33,367 --> 00:55:38,238
7 almonds, 5 walnuts,
boiled vegetables and 12 egg whites.

672
00:55:39,406 --> 00:55:42,609
Every day 12 egg whites!
Then what do we do with the yolks?

673
00:56:01,228 --> 00:56:04,364
Just one bite and lunch over.

674
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:06,033
Should I make one more roti?

675
00:56:11,872 --> 00:56:14,608
Ridiculous.
No food allowed. No parents allowed.

676
00:56:18,045 --> 00:56:21,148
Expecting a Haryana
girl to lose 10 kg weight.

677
00:56:22,115 --> 00:56:25,853
No parathas, no ice cream.

678
00:56:27,521 --> 00:56:29,890
Oh this badminton!

679
00:56:46,406 --> 00:56:49,376
Burn up, Douse
Rise, Burn

680
00:56:49,476 --> 00:56:52,279
Live, Die
Struggle, Survive

681
00:56:52,513 --> 00:56:58,418
No requests, polite
Snatch that chance

682
00:56:58,519 --> 00:57:01,488
Slip, Rise
Gain stride

683
00:57:01,655 --> 00:57:04,491
lamber up to sky,
Step at a time

684
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:10,497
Caveat for the voyage
Never look back

685
00:57:10,731 --> 00:57:16,003
In the spirit of winning,
no room for failure

686
00:57:16,737 --> 00:57:22,476
One life is all there is,
no second thought

687
00:57:25,979 --> 00:57:31,852
Why be a bird,
When the sky is what I want to be

688
00:57:31,985 --> 00:57:38,659
Why remain a mere page,
When an epic is what I want to be

689
00:57:46,867 --> 00:57:49,970
10.2 kilos. 48 days.

690
00:57:56,543 --> 00:58:00,747
Agile. Deceptive. Anticipating.

691
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:17,531
Good.

692
00:58:24,905 --> 00:58:26,039
Enough!

693
00:58:26,473 --> 00:58:27,908
Do you even realize what you're doing?

694
00:58:30,744 --> 00:58:32,112
You're playing brilliantly.

695
00:58:35,983 --> 00:58:37,351
You've arrived.

696
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,221
Rohan, did you see?

697
00:58:41,855 --> 00:58:42,623
Yes.

698
00:58:44,491 --> 00:58:46,894
You should go and talk to Sir.

699
00:58:47,361 --> 00:58:49,997
At best he'll say no, right?

700
00:58:51,231 --> 00:58:52,165
Go meet him.

701
00:58:53,233 --> 00:58:54,001
Saina...

702
00:58:55,736 --> 00:58:57,604
remember... World No. 1?

703
00:58:57,971 --> 00:58:58,739
You go.

704
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:06,113
Allot Nisha court number 1...

705
00:59:07,281 --> 00:59:09,483
and tell her to practice for 2 hours.

706
00:59:10,484 --> 00:59:11,351
Yes?

707
00:59:13,153 --> 00:59:14,221
Sir, may I?

708
00:59:14,788 --> 00:59:15,722
Come in.

709
00:59:16,857 --> 00:59:18,859
Allot Ragini Pandey court number 2.

710
00:59:19,493 --> 00:59:20,527
Ensure the shifting.

711
00:59:23,397 --> 00:59:24,231
Give her 30 minutes.

712
00:59:24,364 --> 00:59:25,232
Yes, tell me.

713
00:59:25,999 --> 00:59:28,502
Sir... I needed to talk to you.

714
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:36,243
You must have observed I
defeat all the girls in the academy.

715
00:59:37,744 --> 00:59:39,146
That's no big deal.

716
00:59:40,914 --> 00:59:44,117
I want to do something big, Sir...

717
00:59:44,418 --> 00:59:48,622
... send me for the Philippines Open.

718
00:59:48,722 --> 00:59:49,990
I want to play.

719
00:59:50,858 --> 00:59:52,726
But there's no Junior category there.

720
00:59:53,126 --> 00:59:55,762
I'm aware, Sir. It's a World Series.

721
00:59:55,996 --> 00:59:59,867
I want to play in the Women's category.

722
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,608
You want to play in the Seniors'?

723
01:00:08,642 --> 01:00:09,743
Yes Sir.

724
01:00:11,745 --> 01:00:15,649
You want to play with
the big girls of the world?

725
01:00:17,351 --> 01:00:19,119
Do you know who's playing there?

726
01:00:19,286 --> 01:00:21,889
Xu Huaiwen, Julia Wong.

727
01:00:22,489 --> 01:00:24,291
They are the top players of the world.

728
01:00:25,292 --> 01:00:27,895
So what Sir! I'll demolish them!

729
01:00:27,995 --> 01:00:31,999
Sir, I'll break the Great Wall of China!

730
01:00:34,368 --> 01:00:36,103
You want to break China's wall?

731
01:00:37,604 --> 01:00:39,640
Okay. Write her name down.

732
01:00:42,643 --> 01:00:44,978
But I won't be coming, though.
I'm busy with the other girls.

733
01:00:46,613 --> 01:00:49,850
-If you'll not come, who will?
-Bimbisaar Babu.

734
01:00:51,118 --> 01:00:53,353
Bimbisaar Babu?
Please don't do this Sir.

735
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:54,988
I don't have time.

736
01:00:58,859 --> 01:01:00,494
You want to break The
Great Wall of China, right?

737
01:01:00,894 --> 01:01:02,496
-Yes sir.
-So, why're you standing here?

738
01:01:03,497 --> 01:01:04,498
Go practice.

739
01:01:06,867 --> 01:01:08,035
-Give me.
-Yes sir.

740
01:01:10,237 --> 01:01:11,371
Thank you sir.

741
01:01:12,105 --> 01:01:13,106
Raman...

742
01:01:14,408 --> 01:01:16,143
and Damodar.
Write his name.

743
01:01:18,145 --> 01:01:19,246
Court four.

744
01:01:19,479 --> 01:01:22,416
Sir, seriously... put her name?

745
01:01:29,489 --> 01:01:30,991
It's a new tournament.

746
01:01:31,625 --> 01:01:34,661
She'll watch the top players
of the world and pick up a thing or two.

747
01:01:36,096 --> 01:01:41,502
Anyway, where've China & Malaysia
ever let India reach the quarters.

748
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:46,373
Big thing if she even
reaches the second round.

749
01:01:47,474 --> 01:01:51,478
Can't understand players these days.

750
01:01:56,783 --> 01:02:00,020
-Should I write her name down?
-Yes.

751
01:02:12,232 --> 01:02:14,735
-Hey, seen Kashyap and gang?
-No.

752
01:02:42,663 --> 01:02:45,365
Saina, World No. 1.

753
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,971
With this one gesture he stole my heart.

754
01:02:52,472 --> 01:02:57,244
With so much faith invested
what else do you need to do?

755
01:02:58,645 --> 01:03:01,114
Just go and demolish!

756
01:03:02,115 --> 01:03:04,351
It began explosively.

757
01:03:04,985 --> 01:03:09,356
Defeated Yin in the first
round and broke The Wall of China.

758
01:03:09,857 --> 01:03:12,893
Finished Malaysia's
Lai in the second round.

759
01:03:13,227 --> 01:03:16,363
And then Ai Goto of Japan.

760
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:20,734
Demolished every opponent.

761
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:23,003
For the first time an Indian
girl has stepped into the...

762
01:03:23,103 --> 01:03:25,372
finals of an International World
Badminton Series.

763
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:27,241
That's Saina Nehwal!

764
01:03:27,374 --> 01:03:29,743
-Usha Rani! Usha Rani!
-Mummy!

765
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:31,745
-What happened?
-Come fast.

766
01:03:32,646 --> 01:03:34,114
Saina's in the news.

767
01:03:34,248 --> 01:03:36,783
She is going to play in the finals
of the World Women's Philippines Open.

768
01:03:38,485 --> 01:03:39,720
-Her photo!
-Hush!

769
01:03:39,853 --> 01:03:42,222
She'll be facing Malaysia's
Julia Wong Pei Xian.

770
01:03:42,723 --> 01:03:44,491
Will Saina create history?

771
01:03:44,725 --> 01:03:46,360
Every Indian is pinning hopes on her.

772
01:03:46,727 --> 01:03:49,096
I'm Yogita Awasthi for AGCPL News,
signing off!

773
01:03:49,363 --> 01:03:50,898
I'm so happy she reached the finals!

774
01:03:55,602 --> 01:03:59,239
Just a few seconds to go for the
commencement of the Women's Singles

775
01:03:59,373 --> 01:04:02,242
Final here in Manila
at the Philippines Open.

776
01:04:03,243 --> 01:04:06,480
We've got the tournament favourite
Julia Wong up against this...

777
01:04:06,613 --> 01:04:08,615
young sensation Saina Nehwal.

778
01:04:08,749 --> 01:04:11,752
The contest seen for the
first time on such a big stage.

779
01:04:12,286 --> 01:04:14,721
On my right, Julia Wong from Malaysia.

780
01:04:14,988 --> 01:04:17,858
On my left, Saina Nehwal from India.

781
01:04:18,792 --> 01:04:19,660
There she is!

782
01:04:20,294 --> 01:04:21,361
Julia to serve.

783
01:04:21,662 --> 01:04:22,863
Love all. Play.

784
01:04:26,099 --> 01:04:28,735
Julia Wong to serve in
this Women's Singles final.

785
01:04:34,741 --> 01:04:36,243
Missing that, Julia Wong!

786
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:37,611
Very good.

787
01:04:42,115 --> 01:04:45,752
And that should give Saina some confidence
in these early opening stages.

788
01:04:54,027 --> 01:04:56,096
Brilliant smash by Saina down the line.

789
01:04:56,396 --> 01:04:58,866
-Looking very powerful indeed.
-Did you see?

790
01:04:59,032 --> 01:04:59,867
I knew it.

791
01:05:04,404 --> 01:05:07,875
Once again the round-the-head smash
paying enormous dividends for Saina.

792
01:05:11,778 --> 01:05:13,847
Saina's power play coming to the fore!

793
01:05:13,981 --> 01:05:15,849
Again! And Again!

794
01:05:17,251 --> 01:05:20,220
Back to back points here
with an explosive gameplay.

795
01:05:20,387 --> 01:05:23,624
She's got Julia on tenterhooks at
this final.

796
01:05:23,724 --> 01:05:25,626
-19-14.
-C'mon! Last 2 points left.

797
01:05:27,861 --> 01:05:29,096
Smashes it on the line!

798
01:05:29,229 --> 01:05:30,597
Twenty game point fifteen.

799
01:05:30,731 --> 01:05:35,602
I don't think Julia was expecting such
explosive gameplay from young Saina here.

800
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:37,538
Terrific power!

801
01:05:37,638 --> 01:05:41,608
Wooaah! And with that
Saina wraps up this first game.

802
01:05:43,243 --> 01:05:44,478
21-15.

803
01:05:44,611 --> 01:05:45,979
First game won by Saina Nehwal.

804
01:05:46,113 --> 01:05:48,749
Get the sweets ready.

805
01:05:50,017 --> 01:05:53,020
Sir, she won the first game. 21-15.

806
01:05:54,655 --> 01:05:56,223
She'll win the second set also.

807
01:05:56,523 --> 01:05:58,892
Saina's been terrific this tournament

808
01:05:58,992 --> 01:06:02,095
and she continues her
good form in today's game.

809
01:06:05,032 --> 01:06:09,002
Who could've thought that an 86th
ranked player like Saina Nehwal...

810
01:06:09,236 --> 01:06:12,873
would send shivers down
the spine of Julia Wong.

811
01:06:15,609 --> 01:06:16,910
Players back on court.

812
01:06:16,977 --> 01:06:18,846
Julia Wong under pressure.

813
01:06:19,012 --> 01:06:21,748
Absolutely trounced in that first game.

814
01:06:21,982 --> 01:06:24,518
She walks back into
court after pep talk.

815
01:06:25,419 --> 01:06:27,621
She needs to win this second game.

816
01:06:27,988 --> 01:06:33,126
I anticipate very solid &
very strong play from both players.

817
01:06:34,995 --> 01:06:35,896
Second game.

818
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:37,397
Love all. Play.

819
01:06:37,998 --> 01:06:39,733
Saina getting us underway here.

820
01:06:45,372 --> 01:06:48,141
Oh! An unforced error there from Saina.

821
01:06:48,275 --> 01:06:49,109
One-love.

822
01:06:49,243 --> 01:06:51,044
She's not going to be happy about that.

823
01:06:51,144 --> 01:06:54,147
She knows how valuable
these early points are.

824
01:07:01,221 --> 01:07:02,656
Good play by Julia!

825
01:07:05,626 --> 01:07:09,363
And, oh!
Excellent judgement there by Julia.

826
01:07:09,596 --> 01:07:12,533
Saina relying too much on her power play.

827
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:16,103
Julia Wong playing a
purely tactical game here.

828
01:07:16,236 --> 01:07:18,472
The talk of the coach clearly working.

829
01:07:22,976 --> 01:07:26,280
There again!
Julia getting the better of Saina.

830
01:07:26,613 --> 01:07:27,347
Interval.

831
01:07:27,614 --> 01:07:30,984
Saina Nehwal with her
back up against the wall.

832
01:07:31,251 --> 01:07:34,788
Julia Wong with a huge lead at 11-2...

833
01:07:34,888 --> 01:07:37,291
as we head into the mid-game interval.

834
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:12,993
Julia had suddenly begun dominating me.

835
01:08:14,127 --> 01:08:16,997
It's as if she'd read my natural game.

836
01:08:17,865 --> 01:08:20,734
I was just smashing away.

837
01:08:25,372 --> 01:08:26,907
Need to change gear.

838
01:08:27,774 --> 01:08:30,878
Against the world's most
promising badminton player,

839
01:08:31,612 --> 01:08:33,981
playing instinctively is not enough.

840
01:08:34,781 --> 01:08:36,116
I need strategy.

841
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:38,018
11-2. Play.

842
01:08:40,387 --> 01:08:42,122
Julia Wong to resume play.

843
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:46,493
Perfect play from Saina.

844
01:08:46,627 --> 01:08:47,528
Agility.

845
01:08:48,295 --> 01:08:49,363
Quickness.

846
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:51,999
Light on the feet like a cat.

847
01:08:53,534 --> 01:08:58,605
Beautifully placed!
3-11! 4-11! 5-11! 6-11!

848
01:08:58,739 --> 01:08:59,907
Deception.

849
01:09:00,874 --> 01:09:03,544
Lead elsewhere, then shift target!

850
01:09:05,779 --> 01:09:09,416
Show one, do another!

851
01:09:09,516 --> 01:09:11,985
Julia Wong with her back to the ropes.

852
01:09:12,986 --> 01:09:14,988
It's unbelievable what's happening here.

853
01:09:15,122 --> 01:09:16,290
Anticipation.

854
01:09:17,357 --> 01:09:19,293
Wait for the shuttle.

855
01:09:20,494 --> 01:09:22,596
And then, smash!

856
01:09:24,264 --> 01:09:26,099
And she's done it!

857
01:09:27,534 --> 01:09:30,404
She clinched the Philippines Open.

858
01:09:31,238 --> 01:09:35,409
She has just become the
first Indian woman to win a

859
01:09:35,542 --> 01:09:41,348
four-star International Badminton
event and in such a grand fashion.

860
01:09:42,249 --> 01:09:45,519
I mean the fight back in
the second game was unbelievable.

861
01:09:46,153 --> 01:09:48,655
This has been a privilege...

862
01:09:48,856 --> 01:09:53,293
to witness the arrival of this
young star on the badminton horizon.

863
01:09:54,294 --> 01:09:59,867
Wonderfully whittled by badminton
champion coach Sarvadhamaan Rajan.

864
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:03,904
Ladies and Gentlemen,
remember the name, Saina Nehwal.

865
01:10:04,037 --> 01:10:06,406
She is here to stay.

866
01:10:10,277 --> 01:10:11,278
-Hello.
-Hey!

867
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:14,147
How does it feel?

868
01:10:14,481 --> 01:10:17,417
We were watching
you live at the academy.

869
01:10:17,851 --> 01:10:18,986
What fun!

870
01:10:20,487 --> 01:10:21,355
What're you doing?

871
01:10:22,289 --> 01:10:25,993
Sitting in my hotel room and
eating a scoop of vanilla ice-cream...

872
01:10:27,394 --> 01:10:28,996
all by myself.

873
01:10:29,096 --> 01:10:30,864
All by yourself!

874
01:10:31,231 --> 01:10:33,233
So, should I have
it with Bimbisaar Babu?

875
01:10:38,038 --> 01:10:42,543
But must admit,
it tastes as sweet, even alone.

876
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:44,244
What?

877
01:10:44,611 --> 01:10:47,247
Ice-cream... or Victory?

878
01:11:01,728 --> 01:11:04,164
Saina, Saina!
Saina, Saina! Saina, Saina!

879
01:11:05,032 --> 01:11:14,274
Saina, Saina!
Saina, Saina! Saina, Saina!

880
01:11:14,608 --> 01:11:23,984
Saina, Saina!
Saina, Saina! Saina, Saina!

881
01:11:55,782 --> 01:11:59,620
All of you, please wait outside.
Please, please.

882
01:12:10,731 --> 01:12:11,999
I must admit,

883
01:12:12,599 --> 01:12:14,401
you beat my expectations.

884
01:12:20,974 --> 01:12:22,476
More power to you.

885
01:12:23,377 --> 01:12:24,478
Thank you Sir.

886
01:12:30,984 --> 01:12:32,753
A lot of media outside.

887
01:12:35,155 --> 01:12:36,990
Not good to keep them waiting.

888
01:12:42,763 --> 01:12:43,897
Okay Sir.

889
01:13:02,783 --> 01:13:05,285
Ma'am, Ma'am.

890
01:13:14,394 --> 01:13:18,098
He's dreamt this dream with us
and he is very happy with the win.

891
01:13:18,232 --> 01:13:20,000
Ma'am, Ma'am.

892
01:13:20,501 --> 01:13:23,871
The soaring heights of achievement
are intoxicating.

893
01:13:24,538 --> 01:13:31,245
Lost in the high, you never realize
that there could be turbulence in the flight ahead.

894
01:13:57,571 --> 01:13:59,473
Surprise!

895
01:13:59,606 --> 01:14:03,377
Happy birthday, happy birthday!

896
01:14:03,477 --> 01:14:05,179
Wake up, sleeping beauty.

897
01:14:05,445 --> 01:14:07,814
She is without her badminton racket.

898
01:14:09,449 --> 01:14:11,318
It's 12 o'clock.

899
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:15,055
She's still thinking
it's her 3 AM practice alarm.

900
01:14:22,196 --> 01:14:23,230
Just stop it.

901
01:14:23,363 --> 01:14:24,831
Happy birthday!

902
01:14:24,998 --> 01:14:25,699
Enough.

903
01:14:25,832 --> 01:14:29,203
Let him sing.
Aunty, he'll sing the whole song.

904
01:14:29,803 --> 01:14:30,971
Happy birthday Saina.

905
01:14:31,104 --> 01:14:37,244
The feel of your breath,

906
01:14:37,878 --> 01:14:44,318
I hold close to me

907
01:14:44,985 --> 01:14:54,828
Your happiness and your pain,

908
01:14:54,995 --> 01:14:58,832
I claim as mine

909
01:14:59,566 --> 01:15:06,206
The heart wishes that you smile,

910
01:15:06,306 --> 01:15:12,179
Nothing to fear

911
01:15:13,313 --> 01:15:18,819
I'm near, I'm near

912
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:25,959
Never was, nor will be
As dear

913
01:15:27,194 --> 01:15:31,999
I'm near, I'm near

914
01:15:34,201 --> 01:15:38,972
Never was, nor will be
As dear

915
01:15:42,576 --> 01:15:44,745
It's the same rose I gave you.

916
01:15:52,619 --> 01:15:55,455
Papa had given this
to Mummy before marriage.

917
01:15:55,956 --> 01:15:56,823
Oh!

918
01:15:58,225 --> 01:16:02,596
Of course it's the same rose, you fool!

919
01:16:03,197 --> 01:16:06,500
Look around you,
No one, but us

920
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,436
Both pining...

921
01:16:10,103 --> 01:16:16,476
New longings of first timers,
Never felt before

922
01:16:17,077 --> 01:16:23,951
Wherever I turn, I carry with me,
Cannot escape your scent

923
01:16:24,184 --> 01:16:30,123
Haven't had to ask for more,
From the day I met you

924
01:16:31,725 --> 01:16:38,599
Wasting myself in your arms,

925
01:16:38,832 --> 01:16:44,471
Till day turns to night

926
01:16:45,572 --> 01:16:50,878
I'm near, I'm near

927
01:16:52,446 --> 01:16:56,316
Never was, nor will be
As dear

928
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:58,085
Wow!

929
01:16:59,319 --> 01:17:05,692
I'm near, I'm near

930
01:17:06,326 --> 01:17:11,832
Never was, nor will be
As dear

931
01:17:13,333 --> 01:17:18,972
I'm near, I'm near

932
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:26,079
Never was, nor will be
As dear

933
01:17:43,197 --> 01:17:46,433
-Relax Saina. It's not a race.
-Then stay behind.

934
01:17:49,736 --> 01:17:51,705
-Saina.
-Yes, Sir?

935
01:17:54,441 --> 01:17:55,108
Yes, Sir.

936
01:17:57,077 --> 01:17:57,945
-Kashyap.
-Sir.

937
01:17:58,245 --> 01:17:58,812
Out.

938
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:00,814
Sir?

939
01:18:00,948 --> 01:18:01,748
Leave.

940
01:18:05,319 --> 01:18:06,620
What happened, Sir?

941
01:18:08,488 --> 01:18:10,858
You know, the shelf life
of a player is very short.

942
01:18:12,993 --> 01:18:15,362
Youth is very deceptive.

943
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:17,431
It distracts first...

944
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:19,833
then destructs.

945
01:18:20,434 --> 01:18:23,804
To spend your youth on a relationship
is like committing suicide...

946
01:18:24,238 --> 01:18:25,205
Hara-kiri!

947
01:18:26,707 --> 01:18:28,809
I know, Sir.

948
01:18:29,076 --> 01:18:30,444
I'm giving my 100 percent.

949
01:18:30,577 --> 01:18:31,378
Is it?

950
01:18:31,678 --> 01:18:32,479
Yes sir...

951
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,616
You always find the
same partner to practice with?

952
01:18:38,352 --> 01:18:40,454
I have eyes.
I can see what is happening.

953
01:18:41,455 --> 01:18:43,123
What is happening Sir?

954
01:18:43,223 --> 01:18:44,324
I'll tell you!

955
01:18:45,125 --> 01:18:47,461
Right now an army of a hundred
people are running for you.

956
01:18:48,195 --> 01:18:50,430
Trainers, coaches, team.

957
01:18:50,564 --> 01:18:55,435
And leading them from the front is
the country's best & top most family -

958
01:18:55,836 --> 01:18:58,972
dedicated, devoted, focused -

959
01:18:59,373 --> 01:19:00,440
the Nehwal family!

960
01:19:00,707 --> 01:19:02,943
They are carrying you on
their shoulders and running...

961
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:06,313
and you want to jump
off and get married.

962
01:19:06,947 --> 01:19:08,248
-No sir.
-Is it?

963
01:19:09,316 --> 01:19:10,951
Or you want to be World No. 1.

964
01:19:11,318 --> 01:19:12,252
Yes Sir.

965
01:19:12,753 --> 01:19:15,055
I don't get into anybody's
personal matters or private life.

966
01:19:15,189 --> 01:19:17,124
I don't like it and that's not my style.

967
01:19:17,491 --> 01:19:18,825
I focus only on focus.

968
01:19:19,059 --> 01:19:21,728
Eye on the eye because
that's my job as a coach.

969
01:19:23,697 --> 01:19:25,832
I want to make you World No. 1!

970
01:19:26,066 --> 01:19:27,201
Do you want that?

971
01:19:27,568 --> 01:19:28,936
-Yes Sir.
-Do you want that really?

972
01:19:29,069 --> 01:19:29,937
Yes Sir.

973
01:19:30,971 --> 01:19:32,573
I'll say this one last time.

974
01:19:33,073 --> 01:19:34,741
After that no discussion.

975
01:19:35,108 --> 01:19:35,943
Got it?

976
01:19:37,811 --> 01:19:41,748
What you 'Do' to win
a game is not important.

977
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:47,054
What is important is what
you 'Sacrifice' to win the game.

978
01:19:48,989 --> 01:19:50,457
Just remember that.

979
01:20:14,181 --> 01:20:15,449
What did Sir say, Saina?

980
01:20:15,582 --> 01:20:17,084
Do I look stupid to you?

981
01:20:17,484 --> 01:20:18,585
No.

982
01:20:21,455 --> 01:20:24,191
Since I was 8,
when other girls played with dolls...

983
01:20:24,324 --> 01:20:26,493
and attended birthdays and fairs...

984
01:20:26,627 --> 01:20:29,062
I've gotten up at 3
in the morning for training.

985
01:20:31,231 --> 01:20:34,568
All my life I've played only
badminton and done nothing else.

986
01:20:36,436 --> 01:20:41,608
Don't I realize the sacrifices Mummy,
Papa and Abu have made for me?

987
01:20:42,576 --> 01:20:44,478
Does someone else have
to point that out to me?

988
01:20:45,078 --> 01:20:46,747
Does Sir need to point that out to me?

989
01:20:48,081 --> 01:20:51,318
Sacrifices!

990
01:21:00,694 --> 01:21:02,062
I don't want to meet you.

991
01:21:02,229 --> 01:21:03,430
What're you saying Saina?

992
01:21:03,564 --> 01:21:07,067
Why don't they ask Sachin
why he married at 22?

993
01:21:07,935 --> 01:21:09,870
Because he is a male player.

994
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:12,306
I'm a girl!

995
01:21:12,472 --> 01:21:15,075
My feelings don't matter.

996
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:20,681
I don't want to meet you.

997
01:21:20,747 --> 01:21:22,249
Please don't say this, Saina.

998
01:21:23,450 --> 01:21:25,686
-I don't want to meet you!
-Saina, please listen to me...

999
01:21:59,486 --> 01:22:01,989
Sir told me... leave. I did.

1000
01:22:02,456 --> 01:22:03,824
Not a single question.

1001
01:22:04,191 --> 01:22:06,960
Did exactly what he advised.

1002
01:22:07,194 --> 01:22:08,562
It brought result.

1003
01:22:09,830 --> 01:22:13,233
A new name in the international arena.

1004
01:22:13,734 --> 01:22:16,703
Saina Nehwal from India qualifies
for the Olympics' Quarter Finals!

1005
01:22:16,937 --> 01:22:19,573
Saina wins the Chinese Taipei Open!

1006
01:22:19,873 --> 01:22:21,875
Saina wins World Junior Championships!

1007
01:22:22,109 --> 01:22:23,944
The first Indian to do so.

1008
01:22:50,804 --> 01:22:53,607
Not easy to brush away your past.

1009
01:22:54,808 --> 01:22:58,846
Had to do it because
Badminton stood as my future.

1010
01:23:00,581 --> 01:23:06,119
Just like Dronacharya's Arjun,
I could now clearly see the bird's eye.

1011
01:23:06,553 --> 01:23:11,859
Then began my winning streak...
a flood of World Titles.

1012
01:23:11,992 --> 01:23:13,460
My punches landing right!

1013
01:23:14,494 --> 01:23:17,197
India makes history by winning it's
first gold medal in Badminton...

1014
01:23:17,331 --> 01:23:21,468
in the history of Commonwealth Games.

1015
01:23:22,336 --> 01:23:25,739
Crowd here in Siri
Fort hysterical with joy!

1016
01:23:27,074 --> 01:23:31,578
My Guru's face lit
like a 1000 watt bulb.

1017
01:23:32,579 --> 01:23:35,315
-Now that's her Commonwealth gold.
-And the cherry on the cake,

1018
01:23:35,449 --> 01:23:39,453
India's first Olympic
medal in Badminton.

1019
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:41,822
That changed everything for me.

1020
01:23:58,805 --> 01:24:01,074
Welcome Saina! Please do the honours.

1021
01:24:15,556 --> 01:24:17,958
Okay, costume clear.
Out, out. Makeup out.

1022
01:24:18,058 --> 01:24:18,859
Saina ready?

1023
01:24:19,126 --> 01:24:21,728
-Yes.
-Okay...and...

1024
01:24:22,329 --> 01:24:23,096
Action!

1025
01:24:23,363 --> 01:24:25,699
Flamingo. An aid for a new life.

1026
01:24:26,333 --> 01:24:31,471
Presenting Oleev Active, the ultimate
cooking oil, for everyday cooking.

1027
01:24:32,306 --> 01:24:35,876
Samrat Atta.
A taste that brings all together.

1028
01:24:42,683 --> 01:24:44,084
Excuse me.

1029
01:24:44,451 --> 01:24:45,118
Yes ma'am.

1030
01:24:45,252 --> 01:24:46,553
What's going on?

1031
01:24:46,854 --> 01:24:48,956
My 2 hour commitment is over.

1032
01:24:49,189 --> 01:24:51,859
I've been waiting since
morning with this make-up on.

1033
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:54,061
Can you let me know?

1034
01:24:55,329 --> 01:24:57,698
I'm missing my practice.
I have to go.

1035
01:24:58,065 --> 01:25:00,200
Please call my manager.

1036
01:25:00,334 --> 01:25:02,436
Sorry ma'am. We'll just start.

1037
01:25:10,944 --> 01:25:11,979
Why is the court empty?

1038
01:25:12,246 --> 01:25:13,180
Where's Saina?

1039
01:25:13,747 --> 01:25:15,449
She requested for 2 hours.

1040
01:25:15,849 --> 01:25:16,750
Again?

1041
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:24,057
The court is reserved & it's empty while
players are queuing up waiting.

1042
01:25:26,326 --> 01:25:27,127
Superb.

1043
01:25:34,735 --> 01:25:35,702
Lovely!

1044
01:25:37,204 --> 01:25:38,105
Beautiful!

1045
01:25:38,805 --> 01:25:39,940
Superb!

1046
01:25:55,122 --> 01:25:55,856
Champs.

1047
01:25:57,324 --> 01:25:58,625
You can use this court.

1048
01:26:03,597 --> 01:26:04,731
Enough is enough.

1049
01:26:06,066 --> 01:26:10,938
If the court is reserved
& the player is not present, use it.

1050
01:26:11,805 --> 01:26:12,940
Even if it's Saina.

1051
01:26:13,707 --> 01:26:17,945
One more. One more. One more.

1052
01:26:19,446 --> 01:26:20,747
Sir, one more won't happen.

1053
01:26:21,181 --> 01:26:23,584
I've been smashing
full power since morning.

1054
01:26:24,451 --> 01:26:28,455
If I slip or injure myself,
what'll happen to my game?

1055
01:26:32,059 --> 01:26:35,996
Let's just do a few
more & then we'll wrap it.

1056
01:27:20,574 --> 01:27:22,075
I've been meaning to ask you.

1057
01:27:22,209 --> 01:27:24,211
Isn't Saina crossing limits?

1058
01:27:27,247 --> 01:27:29,583
She's become a youth icon of our nation.

1059
01:27:30,951 --> 01:27:32,753
After Sachin... it's Saina.

1060
01:27:35,222 --> 01:27:37,558
But so much advertising exposure?

1061
01:27:37,691 --> 01:27:39,226
How're you allowing this?

1062
01:27:40,127 --> 01:27:42,729
Olympic medalist, World No. 2.

1063
01:27:43,730 --> 01:27:45,732
I didn't have the heart to stop her.

1064
01:27:46,934 --> 01:27:49,369
One ad after the other...

1065
01:27:49,736 --> 01:27:51,939
This endorsement, that endorsement.

1066
01:27:52,706 --> 01:27:54,208
And then those managers!

1067
01:27:54,308 --> 01:27:55,209
God!

1068
01:27:57,578 --> 01:27:59,179
I didn't want to force my will.

1069
01:28:00,447 --> 01:28:05,085
Shouldn't be a case of sour grapes.

1070
01:28:06,820 --> 01:28:09,223
How can it be a case
of sour grapes with you?

1071
01:28:10,190 --> 01:28:14,228
Offers and opportunities made
a bee-line outside your house, then.

1072
01:28:15,996 --> 01:28:19,366
I mean, you could've been the poster
boy for the Satellite Revolution, Rajan.

1073
01:28:20,334 --> 01:28:21,602
Parvati...

1074
01:28:23,203 --> 01:28:25,305
success is a heady brew.

1075
01:28:25,806 --> 01:28:27,074
It's a high.

1076
01:28:28,609 --> 01:28:32,179
If you can't digest it,

1077
01:28:34,114 --> 01:28:35,449
it can lead to an upset.

1078
01:28:37,618 --> 01:28:38,485
Finished?

1079
01:28:39,186 --> 01:28:40,120
Almost done...

1080
01:29:00,207 --> 01:29:00,874
Nice!

1081
01:29:03,577 --> 01:29:04,678
Sorry Sir.

1082
01:29:08,448 --> 01:29:09,483
Sorry Sir...

1083
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:15,322
Sir, I needed to talk to you.

1084
01:29:16,223 --> 01:29:17,958
Okay change, change. You go.

1085
01:29:18,559 --> 01:29:19,326
Change.

1086
01:29:25,699 --> 01:29:27,201
Saina, do you remember
your first day here?

1087
01:29:29,102 --> 01:29:29,970
Remember what I had said?

1088
01:29:32,973 --> 01:29:34,875
Want to be photographed
with soft drinks?

1089
01:29:35,709 --> 01:29:38,111
Want to hang in posters
at corner stores?

1090
01:29:40,113 --> 01:29:41,081
Get Out!

1091
01:29:42,082 --> 01:29:44,084
Right leg, I said right! Stretch!

1092
01:29:45,686 --> 01:29:46,353
Better.

1093
01:29:49,723 --> 01:29:54,194
When I had built this academy,
brick by brick,

1094
01:29:55,996 --> 01:29:58,031
I had thought it'll bear
fruit in the form of champions,

1095
01:29:58,565 --> 01:29:59,867
who shall serve the sport of Badminton.

1096
01:30:02,569 --> 01:30:05,138
To sell soaps and oils,
my coaching is not required.

1097
01:30:07,441 --> 01:30:08,408
Sir..

1098
01:30:09,109 --> 01:30:10,944
Saina, I've never feared for those...

1099
01:30:12,679 --> 01:30:14,815
who dream big which remain unfulfilled...

1100
01:30:18,185 --> 01:30:22,022
...the fear is for those who dream small...

1101
01:30:24,057 --> 01:30:25,025
and fulfill them.

1102
01:30:39,072 --> 01:30:40,207
Now if you'll excuse me...

1103
01:30:40,974 --> 01:30:45,812
these tiny-tiny children
are seeing big-big dreams...

1104
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:47,814
... and they need me... or

1105
01:30:50,184 --> 01:30:51,118
should I say...

1106
01:30:52,986 --> 01:30:54,121
I need them.

1107
01:30:55,355 --> 01:30:58,926
From now on, you'll train with
Bimbisaar Babu.

1108
01:30:59,626 --> 01:31:00,327
Sir...

1109
01:31:00,827 --> 01:31:03,864
Okay, everyone come here!

1110
01:31:07,701 --> 01:31:11,305
I want to ask you, who is a champion?

1111
01:31:11,705 --> 01:31:13,740
-Me! Me!
-Only 4?

1112
01:31:14,575 --> 01:31:16,210
Me too! Me!

1113
01:31:36,363 --> 01:31:37,831
A teacher's blessings...

1114
01:31:39,499 --> 01:31:42,469
are like a warrior's shield.

1115
01:31:44,938 --> 01:31:46,473
Where did I lose my shield?

1116
01:31:47,808 --> 01:31:49,142
Why did I lose my shield?

1117
01:31:50,811 --> 01:31:52,813
Match won by Yui Hashimoto.

1118
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:56,483
Match won by Sun Yui 21-16, 21-15.

1119
01:31:57,317 --> 01:31:59,453
21-17, 21-10.

1120
01:32:00,621 --> 01:32:02,823
Title goes to Wan Yihan.

1121
01:32:08,495 --> 01:32:10,964
Wonder what's happened
to Saina Nehwal's game.

1122
01:32:11,365 --> 01:32:13,700
Doesn't seem to be in good nick.

1123
01:32:17,437 --> 01:32:19,439
And Saina Nehwal slips!

1124
01:32:20,874 --> 01:32:22,643
Guess she has twisted her heel.

1125
01:32:23,810 --> 01:32:26,480
Looks like she's in unbearable pain.

1126
01:32:29,316 --> 01:32:30,817
The doctors have arrived on court.

1127
01:32:31,084 --> 01:32:33,453
They are checking Saina's injury.

1128
01:32:34,555 --> 01:32:36,690
Guess Saina needs a stretcher.

1129
01:32:38,559 --> 01:32:41,195
We have been told it's a serious injury.

1130
01:33:05,319 --> 01:33:07,454
Hey, are you feeling okay?

1131
01:33:10,791 --> 01:33:12,192
I'll give you a rundown on her feeling.

1132
01:33:13,894 --> 01:33:16,296
The doctor has prescribed
a 2 month rehab.

1133
01:33:18,165 --> 01:33:20,100
Has even forbidden from
putting her foot on the ground.

1134
01:33:21,168 --> 01:33:24,338
With game comes injury.

1135
01:33:28,408 --> 01:33:30,511
Papa, everything is fine.

1136
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:43,023
Did Rajan Sir visit?

1137
01:33:44,324 --> 01:33:45,425
He's in Jakarta.

1138
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:47,995
Tomorrow the whole troop is returning.

1139
01:33:56,036 --> 01:33:57,671
Ma'am. It's time for a sponge bath.

1140
01:33:58,405 --> 01:34:00,240
Step outside.

1141
01:34:02,042 --> 01:34:03,043
Let's go.

1142
01:34:22,896 --> 01:34:27,167
The bad news is that due to her injury,
Saina Nehwal has slipped from World No. 2

1143
01:34:27,201 --> 01:34:28,702
to World No. 9.

1144
01:34:29,269 --> 01:34:32,206
She's so bad that she can't
even step on to the court.

1145
01:34:32,306 --> 01:34:36,443
Meanwhile,
her juniors are scaling new heights.

1146
01:34:37,077 --> 01:34:39,947
The way the scales
are tipping for Saina,

1147
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:45,452
the glorious sun of Saina's run seems
to be dipping into the horizon.

1148
01:34:46,286 --> 01:34:49,022
It's Yogita Awasthi for AGCPL News,
signing off!

1149
01:34:53,393 --> 01:34:54,995
Guys, coffee?

1150
01:34:56,163 --> 01:34:58,365
Saina, do you want a coffee?

1151
01:35:04,938 --> 01:35:06,273
So, how was Jakarta?

1152
01:35:08,642 --> 01:35:09,710
Wasn't good.

1153
01:35:10,444 --> 01:35:11,311
Forget it.

1154
01:35:14,147 --> 01:35:15,449
Chill.

1155
01:35:16,517 --> 01:35:17,551
Which is the next one?

1156
01:35:18,151 --> 01:35:18,952
Copenhagen.

1157
01:35:24,458 --> 01:35:27,394
I wish I could also come.

1158
01:35:28,662 --> 01:35:30,430
Why do you need to come, Saina.

1159
01:35:30,831 --> 01:35:34,935
You have everything. 2010. 2012.

1160
01:35:36,036 --> 01:35:37,671
Such fabulous years.

1161
01:35:39,072 --> 01:35:43,544
You have all the Super Series
Championships and an Olympic Bronze too.

1162
01:35:43,944 --> 01:35:46,013
Who has these many titles in India?

1163
01:35:47,147 --> 01:35:52,152
Just take a chill pill. Relax.

1164
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:54,688
Write a fab autobiography.

1165
01:35:56,290 --> 01:35:57,791
You've got lots of time on your hands now.

1166
01:35:59,293 --> 01:36:01,161
Are you done? Should we leave?

1167
01:36:01,895 --> 01:36:02,896
What happened?

1168
01:36:12,406 --> 01:36:13,140
Wow.

1169
01:36:16,710 --> 01:36:18,178
One injury...

1170
01:36:20,314 --> 01:36:22,683
and these guys have
turned me into a flashback.

1171
01:36:33,026 --> 01:36:35,996
Somethings' going wrong, K.

1172
01:36:38,165 --> 01:36:41,602
These last 2 years haven't been good.

1173
01:36:49,009 --> 01:36:50,377
Something's missing.

1174
01:36:53,647 --> 01:36:54,648
Something's missing.

1175
01:36:56,517 --> 01:36:58,352
The elephant walks
undaunted while dogs bark.

1176
01:36:59,786 --> 01:37:01,021
Your process is different, Saina.

1177
01:37:02,289 --> 01:37:06,660
Go meet Rajan Sir. Talk to him.

1178
01:37:08,161 --> 01:37:09,296
Resolve all of this.

1179
01:37:10,464 --> 01:37:11,932
You need to get back into action.

1180
01:37:16,436 --> 01:37:18,038
Keeping the knee straight.

1181
01:37:18,405 --> 01:37:20,274
Very good.
Take it down.

1182
01:37:22,042 --> 01:37:23,043
Up.

1183
01:37:24,077 --> 01:37:26,079
-Slowly down.
-Saina!

1184
01:37:27,648 --> 01:37:28,815
Bend it more.

1185
01:37:30,951 --> 01:37:32,586
Take it down. Very good.

1186
01:37:35,155 --> 01:37:36,089
Chew it.

1187
01:37:37,057 --> 01:37:38,592
One. Two.

1188
01:37:38,859 --> 01:37:41,528
Move your fingers down & up.

1189
01:37:42,529 --> 01:37:43,530
One more.

1190
01:37:44,398 --> 01:37:45,933
And now relax.

1191
01:37:46,066 --> 01:37:50,037
Get up!
You can do it.

1192
01:37:50,404 --> 01:37:51,305
Get up!

1193
01:38:02,649 --> 01:38:03,650
All okay?

1194
01:38:18,031 --> 01:38:20,534
-Oh, surprise.
-Hello Sir.

1195
01:38:22,803 --> 01:38:23,470
Come on, sit.

1196
01:38:29,443 --> 01:38:31,178
Don't think you can begin practice.

1197
01:38:33,146 --> 01:38:36,650
Yes Sir. They're saying it'll take time.

1198
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:41,788
Sir, you didn't come to the hospital.

1199
01:38:43,524 --> 01:38:44,525
Lot of work here.

1200
01:38:46,393 --> 01:38:49,062
So you've come to meet
your friends?

1201
01:38:50,564 --> 01:38:51,298
No Sir.

1202
01:38:52,533 --> 01:38:53,600
I've come to meet you.

1203
01:38:57,538 --> 01:38:58,405
Great.

1204
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:01,708
So, should I stand
up or you'll sit down?

1205
01:39:03,710 --> 01:39:05,512
No Sir, why would you stand up.

1206
01:39:06,079 --> 01:39:08,782
I actually wanted to ask you something.

1207
01:39:09,917 --> 01:39:10,684
Please.

1208
01:39:11,018 --> 01:39:14,621
Sir, looks like you've forgotten me,
haven't forgiven me.

1209
01:39:16,156 --> 01:39:20,127
I did what you told me to,
but I fell out of your view.

1210
01:39:21,028 --> 01:39:23,597
My game was slipping
but you didn't step in.

1211
01:39:25,265 --> 01:39:28,268
Sir, I needed your time, Sir.

1212
01:39:28,702 --> 01:39:31,572
And I didn't give you my time, right?

1213
01:39:34,575 --> 01:39:37,277
I built this academy so
that one day I would witness

1214
01:39:37,411 --> 01:39:41,915
Saina Nehwal being crowned World No. 1.

1215
01:39:42,783 --> 01:39:44,918
-You know that, right?
-Yes Sir.

1216
01:39:45,018 --> 01:39:47,020
I accepted everything that
you did beyond the rule book.

1217
01:39:47,287 --> 01:39:48,889
You knew the academy rule...

1218
01:39:49,156 --> 01:39:50,524
...One mistake and you're out.

1219
01:39:50,824 --> 01:39:51,692
Did I do that?

1220
01:39:52,659 --> 01:39:54,661
-Sir, please I...
-I'm serious!

1221
01:39:55,028 --> 01:39:58,832
From 2004 I have been
giving you 6 hours every day...

1222
01:39:58,932 --> 01:40:02,069
that means if I put math to it...

1223
01:40:03,403 --> 01:40:07,307
25,920 hours of practice.

1224
01:40:07,641 --> 01:40:10,043
My time. My investment.

1225
01:40:11,078 --> 01:40:12,079
Yes sir.

1226
01:40:18,018 --> 01:40:20,020
Even after investing
such a lot of time...

1227
01:40:21,655 --> 01:40:23,991
if I failed to make you World No. 1...

1228
01:40:26,193 --> 01:40:27,928
then it means... I lack something.

1229
01:40:28,662 --> 01:40:29,563
I failed.

1230
01:40:29,830 --> 01:40:32,766
-No Sir. What are you saying...
-What do I say then?

1231
01:40:34,034 --> 01:40:35,335
That 'you' lack something.

1232
01:40:36,670 --> 01:40:37,838
'You' are not good enough.

1233
01:40:38,572 --> 01:40:39,806
'You' failed. Huh?

1234
01:40:44,278 --> 01:40:45,312
Sir...

1235
01:40:46,914 --> 01:40:48,415
why are you saying all this?

1236
01:40:48,682 --> 01:40:51,118
So you tell me,
if you were in my place,

1237
01:40:52,519 --> 01:40:53,453
what would you say?

1238
01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:14,641
Sir...

1239
01:41:17,578 --> 01:41:19,012
I would say...

1240
01:41:21,782 --> 01:41:25,519
that, maybe this academy
isn't right for you, Saina.

1241
01:41:49,142 --> 01:41:50,077
Wow.

1242
01:41:52,513 --> 01:41:54,147
So you've made your decision, already.

1243
01:41:55,949 --> 01:42:00,087
Sir, one should take
one's own decisions.

1244
01:42:01,522 --> 01:42:02,789
Thought about your future?

1245
01:42:03,290 --> 01:42:06,894
I wouldn't worry about
that if I were you.

1246
01:42:09,263 --> 01:42:11,265
Leaving the academy
or badminton as well?

1247
01:42:11,398 --> 01:42:13,100
Sir, can't quit badminton.

1248
01:42:16,270 --> 01:42:22,309
But yes, I'm leaving today what I can.

1249
01:42:28,815 --> 01:42:29,716
Best of luck.

1250
01:42:58,078 --> 01:42:59,880
Had gone to mend what had gone sour.

1251
01:43:01,014 --> 01:43:03,784
Instead, got trapped in
the war of words and on impulse...

1252
01:43:04,284 --> 01:43:06,153
destroyed the bridge irreparably.

1253
01:43:12,025 --> 01:43:14,795
Sir, are the rumours true that
Saina & Rajan are not on speaking terms?

1254
01:43:15,562 --> 01:43:17,931
Has Saina been told
to leave Rajan Academy?

1255
01:43:18,065 --> 01:43:20,067
Is this the end of the road for Saina?

1256
01:43:27,274 --> 01:43:28,942
What to do with them?

1257
01:43:29,276 --> 01:43:30,777
What should we tell them?

1258
01:43:36,083 --> 01:43:40,787
After leaving the academy
and the coach where will you go?

1259
01:43:40,888 --> 01:43:42,155
What will you do?

1260
01:43:42,189 --> 01:43:44,057
Papa, I don't have any answer...

1261
01:43:45,292 --> 01:43:48,028
Where will I go... To whom will I go...

1262
01:43:48,195 --> 01:43:55,669
Wherever you'll go and train,
you'll make them proud.

1263
01:43:56,537 --> 01:43:59,907
Don't give importance to the
media circus. Just focus on your game.

1264
01:44:01,141 --> 01:44:04,711
Don't allow self-doubt to creep in.

1265
01:44:06,146 --> 01:44:07,281
You are a tigress.

1266
01:44:09,316 --> 01:44:11,518
Saina Nehwal is your name!

1267
01:44:18,292 --> 01:44:20,394
Ma took control of the situation.

1268
01:44:21,395 --> 01:44:24,064
She suggested, we leave the city.

1269
01:44:25,766 --> 01:44:27,434
We shifted to Bengaluru.

1270
01:44:37,077 --> 01:44:38,278
Big problem.

1271
01:44:39,146 --> 01:44:41,415
Cinderella has lost her shoe.

1272
01:44:42,649 --> 01:44:43,417
What?

1273
01:44:43,951 --> 01:44:44,685
Don't know?

1274
01:44:45,185 --> 01:44:46,553
Want an answer?

1275
01:44:47,187 --> 01:44:48,155
Yes Sir.

1276
01:44:48,388 --> 01:44:50,691
Have you seen the 'Hall of Mirrors'?

1277
01:44:52,793 --> 01:44:54,795
Have you watched Mughal-e-Azam?

1278
01:44:55,662 --> 01:44:57,197
In that film there is 'Sheesh Mahal'.

1279
01:44:58,165 --> 01:45:01,935
Just like that, we have a
'Hall of Mirrors' in our academy.

1280
01:45:03,403 --> 01:45:05,772
Would you like to step in? Would you?

1281
01:45:07,908 --> 01:45:09,276
There was a little girl.

1282
01:45:09,409 --> 01:45:11,078
She had many six packs.

1283
01:45:11,144 --> 01:45:13,447
She was engineered for high end
attacks.

1284
01:45:13,647 --> 01:45:16,783
One day she had a fall,
it was beyond her call.

1285
01:45:16,917 --> 01:45:19,286
Her spectacle fell off her
nose and crumbled.

1286
01:45:19,419 --> 01:45:23,056
Lol. Now how to get the vision,
how to get insight?

1287
01:45:23,156 --> 01:45:27,160
As she'd never-
ever visited the mirror-lined hall.

1288
01:45:27,294 --> 01:45:28,161
Come.

1289
01:45:28,662 --> 01:45:30,564
Seems to have said something
I didn't get.

1290
01:46:00,894 --> 01:46:08,035
Saina. Saina. Saina. Saina. Saina...

1291
01:46:11,138 --> 01:46:13,307
Okay, settle down.

1292
01:46:13,774 --> 01:46:15,209
Settle down students.

1293
01:46:18,579 --> 01:46:22,149
The day they got to know
that Saina Nehwal is coming here...

1294
01:46:22,416 --> 01:46:23,417
they have called a strike

1295
01:46:23,784 --> 01:46:26,019
and waited for one
glimpse of their goddess.

1296
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:30,958
Saina, when I saw you
play I decided to be like you.

1297
01:46:32,526 --> 01:46:34,428
Saina, you drink magic potion?

1298
01:46:34,795 --> 01:46:36,029
You play so well.

1299
01:46:38,432 --> 01:46:40,567
Saina, is your mother strict?

1300
01:46:45,138 --> 01:46:47,574
Is it true,
you drink 2 liters of milk every day?

1301
01:46:48,141 --> 01:46:49,810
Yes, it's true.

1302
01:46:51,144 --> 01:46:52,412
Excuse me.

1303
01:46:56,149 --> 01:46:57,317
I am Saina.

1304
01:47:00,454 --> 01:47:02,789
I walk like Saina, I talk like Saina,

1305
01:47:02,890 --> 01:47:05,459
I eat like Saina, I dress like Saina.

1306
01:47:05,826 --> 01:47:08,061
My fashion Saina, my style Saina.

1307
01:47:08,562 --> 01:47:12,199
My Instagram Saina,
my Twitter Saina, my Facebook Saina.

1308
01:47:12,933 --> 01:47:15,169
My racket Saina, my shoes Saina.

1309
01:47:16,270 --> 01:47:18,405
My everything Saina.

1310
01:47:28,515 --> 01:47:30,651
How are you little one?

1311
01:47:31,652 --> 01:47:33,020
Saina...

1312
01:47:33,787 --> 01:47:36,523
this is the hall of mirrors.

1313
01:47:37,157 --> 01:47:38,525
Your reflections.

1314
01:47:39,660 --> 01:47:41,428
This is what you mean to the sport -

1315
01:47:41,695 --> 01:47:45,265
to the empowerment of little
girls all over the country.

1316
01:47:46,567 --> 01:47:49,803
Whatever you do from here,
just remember...

1317
01:47:50,137 --> 01:47:52,573
what 'Saina Nehwal' means to the world.

1318
01:47:53,407 --> 01:47:56,410
You are the single most
important thing...

1319
01:47:56,643 --> 01:48:00,781
that has happened to young
women in this sport - in this country.

1320
01:48:01,782 --> 01:48:04,918
Remember, you are the tigress of India.

1321
01:48:05,919 --> 01:48:09,690
And it would be my
honor to be your coach...

1322
01:48:10,290 --> 01:48:14,127
and to be standing by your
side when you become World No. 1.

1323
01:48:21,335 --> 01:48:23,303
Start now, start immediately.

1324
01:48:30,310 --> 01:48:33,313
What a crackling day!

1325
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:36,683
The children were a riot!

1326
01:48:37,184 --> 01:48:39,286
You should've been here.

1327
01:48:39,786 --> 01:48:43,557
Okay listen... we've landed here
without enough to sustain.

1328
01:48:44,024 --> 01:48:46,026
-Kashyap's coming...
-Yes.

1329
01:48:46,193 --> 01:48:49,830
So fill our things in the
big suitcase and send it with him.

1330
01:48:50,330 --> 01:48:51,932
Things are arranged here.

1331
01:48:52,065 --> 01:48:53,166
Number 2.

1332
01:48:57,938 --> 01:48:59,706
The path ahead was difficult.

1333
01:49:00,774 --> 01:49:02,809
I immediately began training.

1334
01:49:05,646 --> 01:49:10,184
-Plus, I had my pillar of strength...
-Number 4.

1335
01:49:10,651 --> 01:49:12,085
... my Kashyap.

1336
01:49:17,658 --> 01:49:19,393
Let's go, one more.

1337
01:49:25,666 --> 01:49:26,900
Come on.

1338
01:49:32,439 --> 01:49:35,275
-One more. One more.
-Come on, Saina.

1339
01:49:40,314 --> 01:49:42,182
The Taj Mahal wasn't built in a day.

1340
01:49:44,418 --> 01:49:46,720
Mine too, was left unfinished...

1341
01:49:50,524 --> 01:49:53,894
I had to repay the debt of 25,920 hours.

1342
01:49:57,831 --> 01:49:59,766
It was a second coming for me.

1343
01:50:02,336 --> 01:50:04,705
The start was slow yet steady.

1344
01:50:05,706 --> 01:50:07,207
Saina on a comeback trail.

1345
01:50:07,407 --> 01:50:10,010
Through to the Denmark
Super Series Quarter Finals.

1346
01:50:10,410 --> 01:50:12,412
I started my winning
trot with the China Open.

1347
01:50:12,813 --> 01:50:16,416
Saina wins the China
Open Super Series Finals.

1348
01:50:18,085 --> 01:50:22,789
Within 6 months my
world ranking improved.

1349
01:50:24,024 --> 01:50:27,861
I felt that I was getting
closer to the summit.

1350
01:50:29,162 --> 01:50:32,699
But there was another
tigress across the continent,

1351
01:50:32,833 --> 01:50:34,201
preparing for the same summit.

1352
01:50:34,334 --> 01:50:36,403
-Look!
-...Carla Martinez.

1353
01:50:36,537 --> 01:50:39,139
Look, how she screeches.

1354
01:50:39,773 --> 01:50:42,309
Scares the opponent!

1355
01:50:42,576 --> 01:50:45,279
Breaks the rhythm of the opponent!

1356
01:50:45,412 --> 01:50:50,184
With rhythm shattered,
confidence withers!

1357
01:50:50,651 --> 01:50:53,387
Without confidence
who can win against her?

1358
01:50:54,154 --> 01:50:55,956
She was in her best form then

1359
01:50:56,456 --> 01:50:59,026
and when it was time
for the Syed Modi Tournament

1360
01:50:59,459 --> 01:51:04,164
it was imperative that I defeat
her in order to emerge as World No. 1.

1361
01:51:13,774 --> 01:51:15,409
But the big question was...

1362
01:51:15,542 --> 01:51:17,644
... how to defeat her?

1363
01:51:18,645 --> 01:51:20,981
The stage is set here
in Lucknow for the..

1364
01:51:21,114 --> 01:51:25,419
Syed Modi International Grand Prix Gold
Women's Singles Final..

1365
01:51:25,786 --> 01:51:31,024
featuring Saina Nehwal of India
versus Carla Martinez of Spain.

1366
01:51:33,026 --> 01:51:35,729
It's a mouthwatering matchup between the

1367
01:51:35,863 --> 01:51:39,566
two best women's singles players
in the world on current form.

1368
01:51:40,501 --> 01:51:45,172
The badminton fans across the world
are looking forward to this match.

1369
01:51:45,405 --> 01:51:46,607
Exactly!

1370
01:51:47,774 --> 01:51:50,110
And leading the way into the arena,

1371
01:51:50,744 --> 01:51:53,046
here comes India's Saina Nehwal

1372
01:51:53,614 --> 01:51:57,851
welcomed by cheering and
applause by this mammoth crowd.

1373
01:52:00,153 --> 01:52:04,858
And here comes Saina's formidable
opponent, Carla Martinez,

1374
01:52:05,659 --> 01:52:08,228
the reigning Women's
Singles world champion.

1375
01:52:10,731 --> 01:52:14,001
Anil, both Saina and
Carla are in their best form.

1376
01:52:14,501 --> 01:52:19,106
Exactly! To predict a winner
between them is very difficult.

1377
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:21,742
Head. Tails.

1378
01:52:22,643 --> 01:52:23,143
Heads.

1379
01:52:23,277 --> 01:52:24,111
You'll call?

1380
01:52:27,915 --> 01:52:28,749
It's heads.

1381
01:52:28,849 --> 01:52:30,417
Toss is in Carla's favour.

1382
01:52:30,517 --> 01:52:32,653
-That side.
-That side? Okay.

1383
01:52:34,521 --> 01:52:37,124
Any player would've chosen to serve.

1384
01:52:37,658 --> 01:52:43,597
But by choosing my side,
she'd declared war.

1385
01:52:45,032 --> 01:52:48,902
Knowingly she has chosen Saina's side,
to unsettle her.

1386
01:52:51,772 --> 01:52:55,108
On my right - Saina
Nehwal representing India...

1387
01:52:55,375 --> 01:52:58,412
India and on my left
- Martinez representing Spain.

1388
01:52:58,745 --> 01:53:00,113
Saina Nehwal to serve.

1389
01:53:00,414 --> 01:53:02,149
Love all, play.

1390
01:53:02,749 --> 01:53:05,152
Saina, Saina! Saina, Saina!

1391
01:53:10,390 --> 01:53:12,793
A good start from Martinez.

1392
01:53:13,393 --> 01:53:14,528
Always plays like this.

1393
01:53:14,661 --> 01:53:16,363
Points 1-love.

1394
01:53:16,730 --> 01:53:19,032
Anil, this is the specialty
of Martinez's gameplay.

1395
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:22,402
Aggressive and dominating play.

1396
01:53:22,736 --> 01:53:27,975
Absolutely! Against Carla, an error
here or there and you're nowhere.

1397
01:53:32,613 --> 01:53:36,283
That's a very uncharacteristic
unforced error by Martinez.

1398
01:53:36,416 --> 01:53:38,418
Points 1 all.

1399
01:53:38,652 --> 01:53:40,454
Is that a sign of nerves?

1400
01:53:43,290 --> 01:53:46,360
Oh oh! She's trying
to break Saina's rhythm.

1401
01:53:46,727 --> 01:53:49,162
Not all games are played
on the court, are they?

1402
01:53:51,598 --> 01:53:55,669
On battleground, one distracted moment,
and the damage is done.

1403
01:53:56,537 --> 01:54:00,107
Each point, a game of life and death.

1404
01:54:01,375 --> 01:54:03,377
Saina, focus.

1405
01:54:03,911 --> 01:54:05,412
Just focus.

1406
01:54:08,015 --> 01:54:10,517
A fiery rally between the two players.

1407
01:54:14,488 --> 01:54:20,360
Must be a reason for the
beating heart to not bend it's will

1408
01:54:20,394 --> 01:54:23,163
That's the point...

1409
01:54:23,263 --> 01:54:25,899
to pull off what others couldn't

1410
01:54:26,033 --> 01:54:28,268
One life is all there is,

1411
01:54:28,368 --> 01:54:31,638
-Points 10-9.-no second thought

1412
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:36,543
Both players pushing their
abilities to the maximum.

1413
01:54:37,277 --> 01:54:38,645
20-19.

1414
01:54:40,514 --> 01:54:41,748
Carla at game point.

1415
01:54:41,849 --> 01:54:45,152
Why be a bird,

1416
01:54:45,285 --> 01:54:47,788
When the sky is what I want to be

1417
01:54:47,888 --> 01:54:50,290
Why remain a mere page,

1418
01:54:50,390 --> 01:54:52,025
When an epic is what I want to be

1419
01:54:52,159 --> 01:54:53,527
Saina hitting it deep.

1420
01:54:54,394 --> 01:54:56,897
Martinez gets into position,
right under the shuttle there.

1421
01:54:59,166 --> 01:55:00,400
And she leaves!!

1422
01:55:01,168 --> 01:55:03,537
Excellent judgement
there from Carla Martinez.

1423
01:55:03,904 --> 01:55:07,774
She wins the first game 21-19.

1424
01:55:11,411 --> 01:55:12,846
Players on court please.

1425
01:55:18,118 --> 01:55:21,221
Stare at me today, red hot Sun

1426
01:55:21,355 --> 01:55:22,389
Tomorrow's my turn

1427
01:55:22,623 --> 01:55:24,291
-Brilliant smash.
-4-love.

1428
01:55:24,358 --> 01:55:29,997
I have double the fire

1429
01:55:30,097 --> 01:55:33,033
Strike when the iron is hot,

1430
01:55:33,166 --> 01:55:35,903
What's there to think about

1431
01:55:36,870 --> 01:55:37,905
13-7.

1432
01:55:38,038 --> 01:55:41,642
A great comeback from Saina Nehwal In
this second game.

1433
01:55:45,045 --> 01:55:49,016
Second game won by Saina Nehwal. 21-16.

1434
01:55:49,283 --> 01:55:52,085
-When the sky is what I want to be
-Very good!

1435
01:56:02,529 --> 01:56:04,364
And it's one game all.

1436
01:56:04,665 --> 01:56:08,735
Impossible to predict which
way the decisive third game will go.

1437
01:56:13,106 --> 01:56:15,375
The start is very
important in this game.

1438
01:56:17,911 --> 01:56:19,646
Players back on court please.

1439
01:56:23,650 --> 01:56:26,653
After two thrilling & engrossing games,

1440
01:56:27,154 --> 01:56:30,524
this match enters the
third and decisive game.

1441
01:56:31,391 --> 01:56:32,659
Saina Nehwal to serve.

1442
01:56:32,860 --> 01:56:34,394
Love all, play.

1443
01:56:37,164 --> 01:56:39,233
Excellent court coverage by Saina.

1444
01:56:39,499 --> 01:56:43,237
Creating that opportunity for
that brilliant round the head smash.

1445
01:56:43,871 --> 01:56:45,906
Points 1-love.

1446
01:56:47,908 --> 01:56:49,576
A good start from Saina Nehwal.

1447
01:56:55,415 --> 01:56:58,652
And that's a befitting
response by Carla Martinez.

1448
01:57:10,531 --> 01:57:14,902
Martinez getting off to a flyer
leading 5-1 now.

1449
01:57:15,769 --> 01:57:18,038
Anil, don't you think
her aggression...

1450
01:57:18,539 --> 01:57:20,974
is affecting Saina's game?

1451
01:57:21,542 --> 01:57:23,043
Absolutely!

1452
01:57:23,377 --> 01:57:27,648
Saina's got to do everything in
her power to filter it out.

1453
01:57:39,159 --> 01:57:41,261
A wonderful down the line smash.

1454
01:57:42,529 --> 01:57:44,398
A befitting response from Saina.

1455
01:57:44,598 --> 01:57:46,533
She gave it back.

1456
01:57:53,407 --> 01:57:55,375
Points 2-5.

1457
01:58:06,653 --> 01:58:08,155
Oh Martinez misses that one.

1458
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:15,596
Lovely!

1459
01:58:16,496 --> 01:58:19,032
Saina clawing her
way back into this game.

1460
01:58:20,033 --> 01:58:22,236
Immense hard work for each point.

1461
01:58:23,537 --> 01:58:25,873
Points 10-9.

1462
01:58:27,107 --> 01:58:28,909
Heading to mid-game interval.

1463
01:58:41,288 --> 01:58:43,390
And Martinez takes the point.

1464
01:58:43,891 --> 01:58:45,893
Points 11-9.

1465
01:58:46,793 --> 01:58:47,794
Interval.

1466
01:58:52,032 --> 01:58:53,233
It's such a close game!

1467
01:58:53,367 --> 01:58:56,670
Anil, but I must admit,
Carla has a slight edge.

1468
01:58:56,770 --> 01:59:00,040
I agree. Carla brimming with confidence.

1469
01:59:03,610 --> 01:59:05,145
And look at the coaches.

1470
01:59:05,479 --> 01:59:08,782
The mid-game interval is
where their contribution comes in.

1471
01:59:08,916 --> 01:59:11,652
Enjoy!

1472
01:59:12,419 --> 01:59:14,021
Players back on court please.

1473
01:59:17,157 --> 01:59:19,226
Martinez getting us underway.

1474
01:59:28,168 --> 01:59:31,104
Thanks to this brilliant smash by
Martinez, she is leading with 12-9.

1475
01:59:38,412 --> 01:59:40,414
An astounding backhand smash.

1476
01:59:46,286 --> 01:59:48,288
Martinez leading 13-9.

1477
01:59:58,365 --> 01:59:59,766
It's 14-9.

1478
02:00:01,368 --> 02:00:02,736
C'mon Saina!

1479
02:00:03,003 --> 02:00:10,911
Saina, Saina! Saina, Saina!

1480
02:00:11,144 --> 02:00:13,914
And don't they love her.

1481
02:00:14,147 --> 02:00:19,119
Saina, Saina! Saina, Saina!

1482
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:25,025
Saina, Saina! Saina, Saina!

1483
02:00:35,235 --> 02:00:38,372
The crowd participating there.
The Ho-Ha, Ho-Ha!

1484
02:00:38,539 --> 02:00:41,041
And amazingly she's raised her game.

1485
02:00:46,013 --> 02:00:48,148
Very good!

1486
02:00:48,515 --> 02:00:51,485
Saina going for the
kill with lethal smashes.

1487
02:00:52,853 --> 02:00:58,492
Both players are showcasing their
best form in this tough competition.

1488
02:01:01,361 --> 02:01:04,731
This match has been
on for more than an hour.

1489
02:01:05,265 --> 02:01:12,139
A badminton match like this demands
more stamina than a day's cricket match.

1490
02:01:12,272 --> 02:01:14,908
Both players look completely exhausted.

1491
02:01:15,042 --> 02:01:19,012
These tough women aren't done yet.
It's badminton of the highest order.

1492
02:01:19,146 --> 02:01:20,914
One thing's for sure.

1493
02:01:21,148 --> 02:01:25,352
Whichever way this match goes,
badminton is the true winner.

1494
02:01:31,525 --> 02:01:33,727
Points 23 all.

1495
02:01:52,513 --> 02:01:53,480
Saina!

1496
02:01:59,853 --> 02:02:01,021
Saina!

1497
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:13,800
Saina...

1498
02:02:17,237 --> 02:02:19,173
you're holding a racket or a sword?

1499
02:02:22,910 --> 02:02:27,181
Who thinks he'll become
World No.1 badminton player?

1500
02:02:31,285 --> 02:02:33,220
Like the human pyramid game...

1501
02:02:34,521 --> 02:02:36,156
... only one reaches the top...

1502
02:02:37,357 --> 02:02:41,929
... but helped by the shoulders
of team mates to reach the heights.

1503
02:02:44,531 --> 02:02:50,204
The pot of gold is in clear sight now,
one should lunge!

1504
02:02:50,971 --> 02:02:54,908
If you slip and fall, those
very shoulders will absorb your fall.

1505
02:02:56,410 --> 02:03:00,280
But if you hit jackpot...

1506
02:03:01,014 --> 02:03:02,749
... then you've created history!

1507
02:03:06,119 --> 02:03:11,625
Martinez serving at 23-all
in this humdinger of a contest.

1508
02:03:21,034 --> 02:03:24,371
And that's gone out,
giving Saina match point.

1509
02:03:24,404 --> 02:03:26,139
Match point 23.

1510
02:03:27,541 --> 02:03:28,775
Oh wait a minute!

1511
02:03:29,910 --> 02:03:32,679
Carla Martinez challenges
the shuttle call out!

1512
02:03:34,915 --> 02:03:38,519
Upon Martinez's challenge
the whole stadium goes silent.

1513
02:03:44,791 --> 02:03:47,628
And it's out by the
narrowest of margins.

1514
02:03:49,029 --> 02:03:52,266
Saina on match point. 24-23.

1515
02:03:54,768 --> 02:03:58,205
Points 24. Match point 23.

1516
02:04:30,137 --> 02:04:32,272
Oh that's taken the racket frame!

1517
02:04:32,406 --> 02:04:35,042
And Saina's totally
out of position for that.

1518
02:04:35,142 --> 02:04:37,411
She puts in a desperate dive.

1519
02:04:37,644 --> 02:04:42,282
And amazingly she reaches the shuttle
millimeters from the ground.

1520
02:04:42,783 --> 02:04:44,251
And she's done it!

1521
02:04:45,018 --> 02:04:48,155
Saina wins the Syed
Modi Grand Prix Gold!

1522
02:04:48,288 --> 02:04:51,892
What a fitting finale
to a sensational match!

1523
02:05:06,974 --> 02:05:08,141
Look at her!

1524
02:05:08,475 --> 02:05:10,410
On top of the world.

1525
02:05:11,645 --> 02:05:15,282
A superhuman effort
that will remain etched

1526
02:05:15,516 --> 02:05:18,952
in the memory of everyone
privileged to have seen it.

1527
02:05:27,861 --> 02:05:29,596
It was such a thrilling match.

1528
02:05:30,097 --> 02:05:31,398
Absolutely!

1529
02:05:31,765 --> 02:05:38,605
This victory of Saina over Carla Martinez
signaling a new era in Indian badminton.

1530
02:05:41,542 --> 02:05:47,114
In badminton's history, this match
will be written in golden words.

1531
02:06:08,669 --> 02:06:12,005
You must think becoming
World No.1 is enough.

1532
02:06:13,106 --> 02:06:14,141
But no...

1533
02:06:14,875 --> 02:06:16,043
that's not enough.

1534
02:06:21,615 --> 02:06:26,787
The hopes of over 1.25 billion
people attached to an athlete,

1535
02:06:27,221 --> 02:06:29,122
never allow you to rest.

1536
02:06:47,274 --> 02:06:50,777
Slip, Rise, Gain stride.

1537
02:06:51,912 --> 02:06:54,281
The cycle keeps repeating itself.

1538
02:06:54,915 --> 02:06:58,352
Again and again and again.

1539
02:07:00,387 --> 02:07:04,858
And at such times,
it's your own, that matter.

1540
02:07:06,994 --> 02:07:09,363
Your Mummy, your Papa,

1541
02:07:10,864 --> 02:07:15,269
your family, your friends ...

1542
02:07:21,975 --> 02:07:24,378
Actually I think I should go now.

1543
02:07:26,980 --> 02:07:30,417
Need to hand over these
medals to their true owners.

1544
02:07:30,851 --> 02:07:31,818
Thank you everybody.

1545
02:11:59,486 --> 02:12:03,657
I didn't know anything
about the Olympics and badminton.

1546
02:12:03,790 --> 02:12:08,662
Today if I see this 'Beti Bachao,
Beti Padhao' campaign,

1547
02:12:08,896 --> 02:12:09,897
I don't think it's needed.

1548
02:12:10,030 --> 02:12:12,533
The things the girls are doing today,
it's fantastic!

1549
02:12:12,766 --> 02:12:15,169
In the last Olympics also it was
only the girls who won medals.

1550
02:12:15,269 --> 02:12:20,140
I think everywhere the girls are
one step ahead in sports at the moment.

1551
02:12:20,374 --> 02:12:22,776
I'm really happy to be a girl.
